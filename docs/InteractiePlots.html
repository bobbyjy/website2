Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.","A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.","Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.","As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.","A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.","Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding.

  65<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.<br />points: 87","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.<br />points: 87","price:   69<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.<br />points: 86","price:   22<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A stiff, tannic wine, this slowly opens and brings brambly berry flavors into play, along with notes of earthy herbs. There's a touch of bitterness to the tannins.<br />points: 86","price:   25<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.<br />points: 86","price:   64<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   44<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.<br />points: 91","price:   38<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.<br />points: 91","price:   28<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.<br />points: 85","price:   45<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.<br />points: 85","price:   22<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.<br />points: 85","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar.<br />points: 89","price:   52<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.<br />points: 92","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rich and full in the mouth, packed with red fruits and black cherries. The wine is sweet, while keeping a tannic core. Drink next year.<br />points: 87","price:  350<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024.<br />points: 95","price:   48<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.<br />points: 95","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Proving that exceptional wines can be (and were) made in this cool, light vintage, this estate-grown selection is both elegant and complex. Flavors of mixed wild berries, a streak of tea, a whiff of peach and compelling balance carry it through an extended finish.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.<br />points: 92","price:   73<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rich and opulent, this is a full-throated Pinot Noir. It has ripe berry flavors and a balancing acidity that supports a dense texture and underlay of firm tannins.

It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer—and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins.

The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish.

This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost.

This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley.

Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent.<br />points: 92","price:  105<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.<br />points: 92","price:   85<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through.

It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.<br />points: 88","price:   24<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal.

It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit.

It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day.

This is good for quaffing but doesn't go beyond that.<br />points: 86","price:   32<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Here, Pinot Noir master Richard Longoria offers a more affordable taste of his Fe Ciega estate vineyard (whose other expressions cost upwards of $45 each). Aromas range from cranberry and tart blackberry to black pepper and wet slate, and the flavors hone in on sour cherry and tar. This wine features gripping tannins, so wait until 2016 for an even more optimal experience.<br />points: 89","price:   28<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While the wine is structured, it does also have plenty of ripe, juicy fruitiness that is already delicious. It's an open wine, rounded and rich in fruit flavor. The tannins are likely to smooth out soon, so drink from 2016.<br />points: 89","price:   20<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Earthy aromas and a soft red fruit ripeness are dominated by wood and smoky spice. They give an unbalanced feel to the wine, not allowing much room for the potential of the fruitiness and acidity.<br />points: 86","price:   38<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Unfined and unfiltered, this has a deep garnet color with a little smoky touch at the rim. The aromas resemble ripe cherries and cola, the flavors emphasize both fruit and savory components like sage and smoke and the feel is nicely dry. The way it holds back a bit on richness is fine for a change.<br />points: 86","price:   42<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's a burly amount of black fruit and black tea in this estate wine, concentrated and coiled in a tight tannic structure. The fruit tends toward ripe black cherry and even blackberry, the texture is soft and the finish delightfully marked by a touch of chocolate.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A very earthy Pinot Noir with tinges of mushroom and leather. This is a fine, sipping wine that's concentrated and smooth. A perfect companion to rustic foods, like pork tenderloin or richly sauced pulled-pork sandwiches.<br />points: 92","price:   28<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.<br />points: 85","price:   45<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.<br />points: 87","price:   46<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From the Ferrington and Monument Tree Vineyards, the latter now owned by Twomey, this delicate Pinot has an aura of baked bread on the nose followed by just-ripe Bing cherry. With firm tannins and a subtle texture, it is a delight to drink and to pair. You couldn't go wrong with a pork roast swaddled in mushrooms.<br />points: 92","price:  110<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Goldeneye's estate-grown Pinot, much of it from Gowan Creek Vineyard, this wine is intended to be the best blend from the best barrels. Powerful, with a ripe mouthful of blueberry, it is framed well by oak, giving it a roasted quality and suggestion of forest floor.<br />points: 92","price:   80<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  What stands out about Confluence most is its wealth of plush mushroom and woodsy earth accenting the otherwise rich, ripe, black cherry flavor. Powerful, it offers Anderson Valley's nuances, a dash of spice and bright acidity.<br />points: 92","price:   80<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From a cool site, The Narrows is rich in ripe, dark cherry and a touch of herb, offering concentrated and intense flavors, with plenty of acidity to pair alongside a dish like roast pork tenderloin with rosemary or Quiche Lorraine.<br />points: 92","price:   26<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Produced from vineyards in the hills above the Côte de Nuits, this wine benefits from the ripe vintage of 2015. It has open red fruit and soft tannins that are both lifted by the acidity. Made to be drunk young, this is ready to enjoy now.<br />points: 87","price:   52<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Small production (one barrel!) single-vineyard Pinots are challenging, as there is no wiggle room via blending. This comes out crisp and focused, with light cherry fruit and ample flavors of tea, herb and leaf.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Earthy with subtle Asian spice and forest floor scents, this wine is medium in build and generous in tannin, still untangling its limbs in the glass.<br />points: 89","price:   60<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age.<br />points: 89","price:  120<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While it does have the structure of a Pommard, this is also a ripe, rounded wine. Its sweet red fruits surround the firm tannins offering richness. A wine that will offer sold pleasure in 3–4 years.<br />points: 89","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A beautifully perfumed wine that shows some of the structure of a Gevrey but combines this with dark rich fruits and sweet tannins. There is a smoky flavor that balances the ripe red fruits and final acidity.<br />points: 89","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A fresh wine with red cherry fruits giving a bright character, the tannins soft and with attractive acidity. It is lightly textured and should be ready to drink in 1–2 years.<br />points: 86","price:   17<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A perfect shade of medium pink, this is a standard, down-the-middle rose. Lemon, watermelon and fresh-cut cherry-tomato notes play on the nose, while the palate packs raspberry and Key-lime flavors.<br />points: 87","price:   38<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Grown along the Bay Area's Peninsula near the heart of Silicon Valley, this wine is brisk and energetic, with raspberry, pomegranate, dried ginger, sage, rose petals and lavender on the nose. Earthiness leads the slightly sour palate, with turned dirt, juniper and iron, finishing on a menthol sensation.<br />points: 87","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Light and tart, with high acid cranberry fruit flavors. It's clean and straightforward, though the old vines (some are 34 years old) do not deliver the complexity that might be anticipated.<br />points: 86","price:   59<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  With a reductive quality and prominent oak, this is a thick, concentrated wine built on unwavering tannins. The fruit is elusive and shy. Clove and cola eke out of an earthy element that's part rose garden, part smoke and eucalyptus.<br />points: 86","price:   54<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a smooth, well-mannered and distinctly varietal wine, richly rewarding in cola spice and earthy black tea, with a juicy finish.<br />points: 88","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Dark strawberry and red-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by the regional pioneer, leveled by scents of violets, rose petals and pencil lead. Graphite and beet juice start the sip, which evolves into black olive, dried basil and bay leaf sprinkled atop cranberry and elderberry juice.<br />points: 92","price:   80<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Subtle fruit flavors mingle mountain berries, plums and cherries with enticing baking spices. There's a touch of herb, earth and tanned leather also, bringing complexity and texture into a lingering finish. Drink now through 2020.<br />points: 92","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This is an open delicious wine, full of red-cherry and red-currant fruit with a touch of minerality to add texture. Some wood aging has smoothed out the crisp fruit and added vanilla to the mix. Drink this ripe wine from 2018.<br />points: 87","price:   65<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine is juicy with intense acidity. Its red-currant flavor is consistent with this acidity. Tannins are firm and will soften. The juicy aftertaste gives the wine crispness.<br />points: 87","price:   52<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Very little of this reserve was produced in 2011. A blend from five vineyards, it spent 10 months in 43% new oak. Firm and a bit steely, it has tight dark fruits anchored in a streak of earth and iron. Give it a few more years in the bottle, or decant if drinking it soon.<br />points: 89","price:   14<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a toasty, tasty, forward and easy-drinking Pinot Noir. Flavors of black cherry soda, cola and light toast are front and center, and the finish comes on clean and refreshing.<br />points: 89","price:   25<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tight and tart, this is packed with concentrated, high-acid flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The wine is young and fresh, with both grip and depth, and should age nicely through 2019–2021.<br />points: 89","price:   38<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Delicately floral in aroma, this soft, earthy Pinot offers blue and red berry fruit that are layered and generous on the finish. Food-friendly, it has the heft to stand up to bigger, bolder flavors on the plate or suffice as a sipping wine on its own.<br />points: 89","price:  304<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Very opulent, very rich, this is a complex, structured wine packed with fruit and brooding tannins. It is already rich, and will develop into a beautifully intense, concentrated and generous wine.<br />points: 96","price:  510<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match. The wine is gorgeously ripe, opening its heart quickly. Acidity, bitter chocolate and dark cherries go with the tannic core to promise long aging.<br />points: 96","price:  370<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A structured wine, with great density of fruit, richness of  texture and at the same time acidity. Its black fruit and red berry flavors are pure and very linear while also giving the wine a full-bodied character.<br />points: 95","price:  360<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more.<br />points: 95","price:  304<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.<br />points: 95","price:   85<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Big and bold, this emphasizes flavor impact. Attractively deep in hue, it stays ruby-colored and fresh-looking at the rim. An oak influence shows in the vivid vanilla and light maple syrup aromas and carries over to the flavors that show a vein of ripe berry fruit, too. Full bodied and velvety in texture, it has ample tannins that help carry flavors to the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   48<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Hatcher delivers excellent value. Concentrated black cherry fruit runs on through a delicious, cherry cola finish. It's dusted with cinnamon and sassafras, and built for cellaring through 2024.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.<br />points: 91","price:   20<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This shows red cherry fruit accented by a black sage and sweet pine twist on the nose. It's rich and spicy once sipped, with clove, cinnamon, gingerbread and other Christmas spices giving character to the red- and black-cherry fruits.<br />points: 89","price:   20<br />points: 81<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Dark red in color this Pinot has a sweetness on the nose and is otherwise flat, not offering much in terms of flavor, texture or finish.<br />points: 81","price:   28<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A fine entry-level Pinot Noir to introduce J. Christopher's expansive single vineyard offerings. This is balanced and true to variety, with clean Pinot cherry cola fruit flavor. There is just a delicate sense of underlying earth and leaf, adding some welcome complexity. Drink over the next 3–5 years.<br />points: 88","price:   17<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here's a most Burgundian, delicate Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at a price that can sometimes deliver clumsy, thin, and/or vegetal flavors. This has varietally-true detail, clean fruit and delightful nuances of citrus, dried herb and rose petals.<br />points: 88","price:   56<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From a vineyard farmed by Ted Klopp of Klopp Ranch, this is a light, spicy vineyard-designate, silky smooth in crisp red cherry and berry. A streak of fresh-picked herb overlays the soft wine, which finishes with a taste of wet stone-like minerality.<br />points: 90","price:   58<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This has lots of fresh, lively fruit characteristics in the aroma and the flavor. It's well balanced, showing good firm acidity and fine tannins to blanket the ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's medium bodied, very appetizing and agile.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Deep cherry, sagebrush and cola are laid across wet slate and purple flowers on a complex nose in this appellation-wide blend from Richard Sanford's team. Crushed wild herbs, like mint, sage, thyme and pine needle are prominent on the palate, backed up by a splash of red fruit.<br />points: 91","price:   37<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Argyle's reserve shows more barrel flavor than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, highlighting an interesting mix of Asian spice and coffee. But the tannins are oddly absent; there seems to be a bit of a hole in the back of the wine. It opens beautifully, then hits a dead spot. A good wine, but missing something.<br />points: 87","price:   24<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle. The finish gets a little tight, with some plastic flavors creeping in.<br />points: 87","price:   45<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is quite light, almost ephemeral, with tart raspberry and red licorice flavors and a strong metallic/mineral streak. It is delicately made, and interesting, but comparable to a simple Bourgogne rather than a wine priced at this level.<br />points: 86","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a light, leafy wine, with tannins that taste of green tea and leave a sensation of astringency long after the wine is swallowed. Sounds like Burgundy! In a world where so many Oregon wineries are making Pinot Noir that is superripe, extracted and alcoholic, this shows why the Burgundy comparison is still valid.<br />points: 86","price:   36<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pierre Léon is a selection of different clones from the winery estate. Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal.<br />points: 86","price:   30<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.<br />points: 85","price:   40<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel.<br />points: 88","price:   38<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A dark and concentrated sandalwood aroma hits the nose on this bottling from west of Paso, alongside strawberries, red currants, smoked meats and a gravelly rockiness. Licorice, anise and fennel drive the palate, which opens up toward concentrated violets, plum fruit and pencil-lead flavors.<br />points: 92","price:   82<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Subtlety and a savory quality help this wine stand out from the rest of the Goldeneye lineup. It has meaty, slightly peppery aromas along with subtle cherry scents, a plush, almost soft texture and delicious, moderately ripe flavors like pomegranate and black cherry.<br />points: 92","price:   46<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Pungent, spicy earth and cinnamon rise out of the wine's bouquet, inviting one to enjoy a structured expression of cranberry, raspberry and black tea. The tannin structure is well managed and the oak strong, yet integrated. Gap's Crown is among the vineyards that figure into the blend, along with several Dutton family properties. This is fresh and focused.<br />points: 92","price:   30<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Silky smooth and delicate, this comes from a long-standing family-run winery in the heart of the appellation. It's a subtle, floral wine offering layers of dark plum and strawberry. Medium-weight and tangy in acidity, black tea and toffee notes linger on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   25<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The nose of this excellently priced wine offers sour fruit from Montmorency cherries, earthiness from squeezed beets, spice from toasted sagebrush and umami from soy sauce. The palate is deep, with a sanguine character that's enhanced by lots of cracked pepper. It delivers plenty of action for the price.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Roasted beets and beef aromas combine with scarlet-red rose petals, peppercorns, black clove, cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose of this wine. The palate offers more cinnamon and purple flowers, with herbal lift from thyme as well as a solidly structurd frame that ensures this bottle will last quite a while.<br />points: 92","price:   25<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  An inviting nose of buttery stewed cherries and red currants grows even more delicious thanks to smoked pork and a black-slate minerality. It's not quite so boisterous on the palate, but it features lovely cherry-pie notes, a slight orange-peel tang, some eucalyptus and a clean finish.<br />points: 92","price:   49<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The aromatics suggest rose petals, while the tart fruit flavors run to raspberries and citrus. The freshness and complexity hint at further improvement over the next three to five years.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This cuvée has the prettiest aromatics of the entire 2012 lineup, highlighted with rose petals and spice. Apples and cranberries are the fruit components, amped up with stiff acidity. It finishes with a faint touch of chocolate.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Three Sixty comes from four blocks of the Bucher Vineyard, planted to a range of clones. Made in small amounts, it offers a wealth and breadth of black cherry, vanilla and smoky oak, the tannins softened and well integrated into the whole. It takes on savory aspects of coffee and clove as it opens.<br />points: 90","price:   58<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  From the family's westernmost vineyard, this bottling is fabulously complex. It shows dense dried fruit and turned earth aromas, along with chaparral, smoke, clove and nutmeg. Those wild elements figure strongly on the sip, which shows thyme, rosemary and sagebrush accents around a core of plum, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors. A vanilla flair graces the finish.<br />points: 94","price:   50<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  As it opens, this wine's ever-so-slightly-dried black-cherry aroma emerges with elegance and power, alongside unending layers of potpourri, crushed flowers, juniper and dark spice. The palate leads with a tart cranberry note that broadens into a warmer strawberry flavor, laced together with tingling acidity and sagebrush spice.<br />points: 94","price:   56<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Juicy dark-purple fruits hold the center of this supple, engaging wine that's still young, with chewy tannins. There's tangy bite to the acids and plenty of muscle for aging. Drink 2020 through 2030 and possibly longer.<br />points: 94","price:   45<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  From a vineyard at 1,100 feet elevation in the southern part of the appellation, this bottling shows light and lively raspberry, plum, white pepper, fennel and damp herb aromas. The palate abounds with red fruit, well-woven acidity and layers of herbs. A raspberry jam note pops on the finish.<br />points: 94","price:   70<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Earthy forest floor and sage notes make for a savory experience in this otherwise juicy wine. Robust, full-bodied and concentrated, it offers developed flavors of baked plum, strawberry and rhubarb compote, the fruit edged with menthol.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From four vineyard sites across the appellation, this coastal wine shows an intriguing note of rose petal and turned earth before unleashing full-bodied waves of chewy, cool-climate tannin. Its rhubarb and red cherry fruit has a savory edge; acidity carries it long into the finish.<br />points: 94","price:   32<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Staete Landt's upscale Pinot Noir eschews dark color and extraction in favor of lighter body and soft tannins. Leather, cranberry and cocoa aromas lead the way, followed on the palate by a pie cherry note and a slightly medicinal green-herb edge. Tart and long on the finish, this wine appears to have the potential to mature gracefully through 2020.<br />points: 89","price:   61<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This is a hard-edged wine, a typical trait of young Pommard.

Wait for at least five years for this wine to be ready.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With a proportion of premier cru grapes in the blend, this wine has weight and structure as well as the ripe red-fruit flavors that are typical of Santenay. It's richly textured and full in the mouth. The finish is fruity and soft.<br />points: 89","price:   31<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Although the winery is best known for top-flight aromatic whites, Spy Valley's Pinot Noir is steadily improving, and the 2011 is a notable success. Plummy fruit is accented by hints of toasty oak and damp moss, balanced by crisp acids and delivered on a soft, creamy palate. Ready to drink now, but the wine should also comfortably go another four years.<br />points: 89","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is stiff and herbal, both in scents and flavors. There's a strong streak of earth dampening the light cranberry fruit. The aging in two third new French oak adds a bit of chocolate to the finish.<br />points: 86","price:   88<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Winemaker Kathy Joseph delivers this seven-barrel ode to her father, who'd be proud of the tight blackberry, wet clay, shaved cedar and iron-rich aromas. The acidity is bountiful but not overpowering on the palate, where elderberry, dried lavender, wild mint and damp earth combine for a deep and lasting sip.<br />points: 94","price:   65<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Just next door to the Corton Grand Cru vines, this vineyard can produce wines of equal quality. This wine certainly has something of the richness and structure, giving it concentration and longevity. Ripe red fruits are cut by dark tannins and equal acidity, allowing the wine to mature slowly and well. Drink from 2020.<br />points: 94","price:   56<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This wine by retired baseball stars Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts shows both ripeness and restraint in all corners. On the nose, that means star anise and slate layered across black cherry and blackberry fruit. On the palate, the very full mouthfeel packs thyme, crushed herbs and elderberry flavors into an earthy package.<br />points: 94","price:   80<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond.<br />points: 94","price:  118<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine comes from a vineyard that is wholly owned by Chanson. It is juicy, ripe while having a great, straight line of acidity. The red-berry fruits are still developing and coming through the firm, smoky dark tannins.

It's even lighter on the palate, where potpourri, olallieberry, black pepper and pencil lead converge. It will age gracefully, thanks to judicious acid and tannins. Drink 2018 through 2028.<br />points: 94","price:   48<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Bright and clear, this young wine is powered by racy cranberry and raspberry fruit.

Jon Meuret (founder of Maison Bleue) has the right stuff, as this new project demonstrates. Drink it now for its pure raspberry and cranberry fruit, its lightly rendered oak, its length and texture. Or wait 8–10 years and watch it develop into a complex, elegant wine with mature fruit and polished, terroir-driven flavors.

The well-managed tannins remain in the background, but put a definite edge around the finish, which wraps up quickly.<br />points: 86","price:   75<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  In some vintages (such as 2004) the extended bottle age given to the Citation Pinot works in its favor. In this latest release, it has subtracted from, rather than added to, rather ordinary fruit flavors. Leather notes in both scent and flavor come up against raisined fruit. Tannins are tough and astringent, and there is a stemmy character to the finish. Drink up.<br />points: 86","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A reductive, bitter rubber component stubbornly dominates this wine.

It's all Pommard clone, offering a burst of pretty cherry fruit backed with stiff tannins and a streak of iron. Still showing some sharp edges, it's just out of 15 months in 50% new oak, and will benefit from aerating or further bottle age.<br />points: 91","price:   39<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine.

It has red fruits, although the structure is what is dominant at this stage. There is a dry, smoky, meaty flavor that marches with the final acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   85<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fruit from this 12-acre site has a well-rounded aspect, with nuanced flavors of pomegranate, marionberry, black cherry and cola.

This is a block selection, and as such it is both precise and also a bit wanting in the midpalate. With ample aeration it fills in, finishing with dark fruit, roasted tannins and a little heat.<br />points: 90","price:   27<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A swell deal for lovers of rich Pinot Noir who can't afford single-vineyard pricing, this countywide blend packs rose petals, stewed red cherries, hibiscus punch, wet gravel, black plum and nutmeg on the nose.

The blend is a two-clone mix of 777 and Pommard, and it captures a range of delicate, well-defined flavors. Raspberry, cherry, light char, smoke, pepper, bitter herb, vanilla and camomile tea come rolling through.

It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries.

It has the round, ripe feel typical of the village, with just a tannic touch to keep it together.

In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Veteran winemaker John Abbott (Chalone, Canoe Ridge, Abeja) jumps back on the Pinot Noir wagon with this new project. This is the second vintage for his Freedom Hill designate, a vintage that was notoriously difficult due to monsoon-like rains mid-harvest. Abbott cajoles the grapes into an elegant, refined expression of high-acid Pinot Noir.

Bright acidity and soft, smooth tannins add finesse and elegance.<br />points: 87","price:   24<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  There is some weight on this young tasting wine.

Touches of wood round it out for aging.<br />points: 87","price:   17<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A lightly perfumed wine, this is soft with warm strawberry flavors. The acidity and texture play a supporting role in this ripe, light-bodied wine.<br />points: 85","price:   33<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a huge Pinot Noir—big-boned all around—tasting of warm climate fruit, with bulky tannins and a heavy oak presence. Let it open a bit to let out the dark plum and earthy spice flavors.<br />points: 85","price:   45<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sharp scents of saddle leather lead into a tannic, earthy wine that remains stubbornly closed even after some hours.<br />points: 85","price:   44<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Nice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   35<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fragrant with cranberry and strawberry fruit, this forward and appealing wine looks and drinks like a cru Beaujolais.

It's a hearty mouthful of wine once sipped, with more sagebrush, clove and garrigue elements adding complexity to the juicy black fruits. There's quite an aromatic mintiness to the palate.<br />points: 92","price:   32<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Lighter in color than many wines from the same appellation, this still packs a complex punch on the nose, with snappy cranberry, crushed slate and peppercorn aromas.

The palate is also quite tart and focused on cranberry and pomegranate, with underlying vanilla richness.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This bold and flavorful wine has a strong black-tea element in the complex flavors, full body and a smooth, mouthcoating texture. It tastes riper and more roasted or beefy than many of its peers and is compelling for its concentration on the palate and length on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:  109<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard.

This Pinot might help matters, a beautifully floral mix of rose petal and violet on the nose followed intricately by juicy, subtle red fruit and buoyant acidity.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This single vineyard in the Dundee Hills recalls Oregon Pinots from days gone by. It's not too big, not too oaky, plenty ripe and delivers spicy berry fruit along with earthier streaks of leaf, herb, baking spices and a whiff of cinnamon. Stiff acids and earthy tannins betray its youth, but though still a little rough around the edges, this could be cellared for a decade or more.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This blend mixes the estate fruit with several different vineyards, making a more fruit-forward, accessible wine than the single-vineyard offerings. Flavors show bright raspberry and tart cranberry, leading to some tangy acids, backed with earth, rock and hints of caramel. The new oak is gently applied, adding to the finish without taking away the wine's naturally juicy fruit.<br />points: 90","price:   36<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine.

It has a dark color with a red-brick rim and opulent fruit aromas. Tangy, mouth-filling cherry and raspberry flavors come with a vibrant, tannic, lively texture. It's a bit tight to enjoy now, but will mellow and mature in the cellar.<br />points: 93","price:   70<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine needs some coaxing at first to come out of its shell. Once settled, it entices in warming cardamom, clove and damp earth, taking on savory airs. Exuberant as it develops, it offers high-toned cherry and tangerine that surround a silky, subtle body. Hints of spicy cinnamon and white pepper mark the finish.<br />points: 93","price:   29<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Fragrant wine, ripely perfumed, its tannins bringing out red berry fruits and a shapely structure. It also has a fresh feel to it from the intense acidity at the end. Age for a year, but drink now.<br />points: 86","price:   14<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.<br />points: 87","price:   42<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth.<br />points: 87","price:   60<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This tart, sleek, pretty wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry fruit. Quite young and fresh, it's still rather tight and stubbornly closed, even after breathing for a full 24 hours.<br />points: 89","price:   52<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine moves quickly past its tight red currant fruit into flavors of red licorice, hints of caramel and a rather light, almost airy finish. Crisp and well-made, but a bit ambiguous.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Erath's Juliard bottling has a bit more stiffness and muscle than the wide-open Hyland, but tails off too quickly to be considered as a cellar candidate. The soft strawberry fruit flavors are wrapped in pleasing chocolate, and lightly spicy, toasty details pop up throughout. It just lacks grips and length.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Big, rowdy flavors like rhubarb and black cherries seem to fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim.

The nicely ripened fruit is set in a mineral-driven, high acid frame, and shows both texture and length as it develops in the mouth. It's especially noteworthy given the moderate alcohol.<br />points: 90","price:   75<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles. Aged about a year in all French oak, 65% of it new, it reveals an expanse of dark cherry fruit, velvety texture and plenty of structure amidst a leathery core and lengthy finish.<br />points: 90","price:   28<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  One of Chile's most honest producers of varietally correct Pinot is Kingston Family.

The longevity of these wines is a proven fact; they evolve (and generally improve) for decades. This is already delicious, smoky, almost ethereal, with truly Burgundian finesse and depth. This wine, as much or more than any other, expresses the potential of Oregon Pinot Noir to approach the majesty of fine Burgundy.<br />points: 94","price:   39<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Tight purple fruit smells of black raspberry meet with violets, crushed slate, dried rose petals, raw beef and black peppercorns on the focused nose. The palate is very slate-driven and rocky, offering turned earth, juniper and more dark raspberry flavors. It is still very tightly wound, and needs more time to unfurl.<br />points: 87","price:   36<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A slip of sour cherry gives zing to this medium-acidity, fruit-forward wine that's both earthy and pinched in toasted oak.<br />points: 87","price:   42<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Very tasty and well-balanced, this wine is fresh, smooth and easy to enjoy, and it stayed that way for two days after tasting.

Highlighted in strawberry and cherry, it retains a tension of black tea and earth. Silky on the palate, it finishes as lightly as it started.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here is your Pinot if you prefer elegance over power. This delicate wine opens with a heady mix of rose petals, orange and lemon peel and raspberry fruit. The raspberry flavors linger gracefully, buoyed by citrusy acidity. The length is impressive.<br />points: 90","price:   38<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Wonderfully aromatic in Bing cherry, this is a soft, supple Pinot with an oaky, tannic backbone that's otherwise light in color and body.

Iijima <br> description:  Notes of fresh cherry and raspberry are peppered with hints of tomato leaf and bramble on this savory wine.

Good penetration and texture.<br />points: 88","price:   17<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  There is a dusty aspect to the aromas and texture of this affordable Pinot Noir.

Medium bodied and softly smooth, it impresses in its brush with the dark side.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine's black cherry fruit, backed by tart acidity and ample tannins, quickly emerges. Cola and brown spice hints reflect its 15 months aging in 15% new French oak, yet it fades on the midpalate as if recently bottled. As with the Carlton Hill bottling, this should benefit from an additional year or two.<br />points: 89","price:   30<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine's dried flower and dark chocolate aromas emerge in the glass, with brambly berry notes in tow. A well-structured effort, it tastes of tart raspberry and cherry fruit with darker streaks of anise and espresso.

Wild strawberry, cranberry and a threading of dried herb combine effortlessly into a pleasurable whole.<br />points: 90","price:   58<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Usually this block is at the top of the offerings from Coeur de Terre, but a leathery aroma and dried-out fruit knock it down in this vintage. Earth, cola, mint, a hint of cherry and a pleasant spiciness are also there, but the saddle leather dominates. Two bottles tasted.<br />points: 86","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a uniquely layered Pinot with concentrated dark-cherry liqueur flavor wrapped in notes of mushroom and dirt.

It starts off a little shaky, offering hints of soap and cruciferous vegetables, but settles down to deliver black cherry fruit and hints of beets and parsnip. It's got a creamy midpalate, then finishes with sterner tannins than most Marlborough Pinots.

It was aged in 10% new French oak.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from the estate's Bayliss-Bower vineyard, this reserve is a barrel selection that saw a touch more new oak (17%) than the regular bottling. It's tannic and a bit chewy, with lush black cherry fruit. Subtle cola and graphite suggestions add complexity.<br />points: 91","price:   85<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate.

The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up.<br />points: 89","price:   36<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  One-third of the wine went through whole-cluster fermentation, giving an edge to a fresh herb and moist earth component.

It's simple, tasty, fresh and ready to go.<br />points: 88","price:   25<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The mid-14% alcohol gives this wine a solid fruit core, much like a California Pinot. Cherry cola flavors hit the palate immediately, then quickly fall away. Bottle shock maybe, but the wine doesn't show the stuffing of past versions.<br />points: 86","price:   37<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Very jammy in character, this is a soft, ripe wine. It seems almost too ripe, a wine that is rounded without great texture. It will be ready to drink by the end of the year.<br />points: 85","price:   32<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Still very young, it's full of acidity as well as bright raspberry fruits that give freshness.

Lively dark red fruit, bay leaf and earthy garrigue qualities arise on the hearty, spicy and lovely palate.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine is produced in microscopic amounts, the result of sourcing grapes from a notoriously difficult-to-farm site. It rewards in flavor: hearty cherry and pomegranate fruit, a crisp, crunchy texture, powerful tannins and oak, and an underlying minerality that presents as elusively as a cloud of fog.<br />points: 93","price:   50<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Cody Wright sources his fruit from an A-list of Willamette Valley vineyards, and Shea is right at the top. Cloaked in a milk chocolate shell, this sophisticated wine melds blackberry fruit with flavor-extending streaks of cola and caramel. In scent and finish, there is a slight intriguing hint of pine sap.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is Tendril's reserve offering, better than ever in 2014. Deeply inscribed flavors of black cherry, cola and espresso come through in a textural, detailed and quite delicious wine. It's the darkest of the winery's Pinots, barrel aged for 16 months and bottle aged for another year prior to release. Toasted nuts, crackers and a dash of salt complete the flavors.<br />points: 93","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a light but classy take on Oregon Pinot, with leaf and herb in front of spicy cranberry and sour cherry fruit.

There is a great juicy character to go with the fresh acidity and the final, drier structure.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Scents of rose petals and cocoa powder elevate the nose, leading into pretty chocolate cherry flavors in the mouth. It's set atop a lightly tart foundation that brings accents of oranges and tangerines, and finishes with a touch of leather.<br />points: 89","price:   33<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here's an interesting, single-vineyard, Dundee Hills wine at a price usually reserved for blended Willamette Valley cuvées. Slightly murky and funky, it's the sort of wine you might stumble upon in some cob-webbed, Old World cellar. The primary raspberry and rhubarb tones have a peppery, lightly bitter quality about them.<br />points: 89","price:   56<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This vineyard-designate opens in bombastic amounts of Asian spice and wild strawberry, making for a whirlwind of flavor and acidity on the palate.

He cold-soaks the fruit and ferments with native yeasts to deliver aromas of raspberry, pine and wet slate. The flavors range from pomegranate to violet to red rose to a fruit punch that lingers a long time thanks to a nice acidic lift.<br />points: 92","price:   44<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The Hitching Post team of Frank Ostini and Gray Hartley hit a home run on this Highliner, with a nose that features fried shiitake mushrooms, violet and sizzling balsamic vinegar. It boasts an elegant mouthfeel, with very round and widely expressive fruit, characterized by orange peel, olallieberry and more violet.<br />points: 92","price:   54<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This Pinot is not hiding behind anything. It has lots of natural-tasting fruit aromas and flavors without overt oak. Flavors recall cherry, berry and rhubarb; the wine tastes firm and moderately tannic, and has medium to full body. Beautifully balanced, it should improve through 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   20<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  First taste was excellent, as the wine entered the mouth with round, ripe red fruit and a hint of spice. But it has something off in the finish, and as it sits in the mouth it loses its freshness and leaves a rather sour, gluey impression.<br />points: 84","price:   20<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  For some tasters, this will seem a bit earthy; for others there is a note of animal. The fruit is thin, the finish chalky and astringent.<br />points: 84","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the most complex and detailed of the current single-vineyard Pinots from Rex Hill. English Breakfast tea, cherry liqueur, moist loam, dried leaf and highlights of cinnamon apple pie all contribute to a feminine, elegant, well-crafted wine.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the winery's reserve-level Pinot Noir, and it's introduced with the loveliest aromas of fresh fruits and cut flowers. Elegant and seductive, the rich berry and cherry flavors come with a light dustiness, like a whiff of incense.<br />points: 92","price:   12<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Dry, spicy, crisp aromas of cool-climate red fruits come with a mild covering of sweet oak. This is a touch resiny on the palate, with woody, spicy flavors of plum and raspberry. An oaky, lightly herbal finish is juicy in feel.<br />points: 87","price:   29<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Possessing intensely floral aromatics, this distinctive wine also pulls in Asian spices, specifically curry. The fruit hangs on the light side of the red spectrum, with a dash of cherry candy.<br />points: 87","price:   40<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The second release of Springhill's Mer Vin (sea wine) Pinot Noir is fruit-driven, and leaves an impression of sweetness along with the fruit flavors of strawberry jam. Powdered sugar and brown sugar and cream are evident, making for a pleasant, forward, easy-drinking wine for near-term enjoyment.<br />points: 87","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pie cherry and raspberry fruit flavors open, with gentle barrel notes of toast and caramel. Balanced and light, this has a pleasing elegance, though a quick finish suggests a lack of depth.<br />points: 87","price:   75<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This big, dense wine is dark in color, with lush, late-picked aromas and flavors and very full body. Its power and oozing fruitiness make quite a contrast with more elegant styles, but there is no denying the appeal of all that jammy blackberry and blackcurrant character.<br />points: 90","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Meaning “from the vine,” this 100% whole-cluster bottling presents black cherry, tart pomegranate, graphite, baking spice and sage bark on the nose. There's lots of dark herbs and dark fruit on the palate as well as black-olive depth and black-slate minerality. With the density of herbs, it's a bit like chewing on sage and eucalyptus.<br />points: 90","price:   39<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rustic cola, wood smoke, fresh-squeezed black cherry and slate emerge on the very compelling and complete nose of this bottling from the longtime winery's estate property. A load of baking spice powers the palate, enhancing the dark blackberry fruit. Its tannic structure is firm, allowing the layers of flavor to emerge with patience.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This graceful wine, from a cool vintage, nicely expresses the more elegant side of Pinot Noir. There are ample fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blueberry, and a pleasantly musky note overlays the maturing fruit. It's rolling along smoothly into a fully integrated finish. Drink now through 2020.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a pretty rose hue, and follows in a light, tart style. Despite its apparent simplicity, it shows surprising depth of flavor, highlighted with fresh strawberries and Bing cherries. There's a touch of Juicy Fruit gum also, and the wine should be consumed now through 2020.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is solidly anchored in its ripe cherry fruit, a rich mouthful that represents the best of the winery's 2012 lineup of reserve bottlings. Highlights of citrus fruits elevate the acids, and there is a pleasing hint of toast across the full midpalate.<br />points: 90","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from 25-year-old vines, this shows traces of dried leaf, along with tart rhubarb and wild cherry fruit.

A whiff of orange peel adds interest. Though aged 15 months in 60% new French oak, it shows little oak influence in its flavors.<br />points: 90","price:   48<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light and clear in color, this impish wine needs time to grow up in the bottle, its profile momentarily giving way almost entirely to savory Asian five-spice and a sharp acidity that should interweave together expertly over the years. Vibrant and complex, the fruit is sultry and dusted in earth. Set this one down through 2017.<br />points: 90","price:   16<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A big-boned Pinot, inexpensively priced, that offers smoke and oak without nuance or layers.<br />points: 84","price:   30<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate.

The spiciness persists through the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   32<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light, clear and crisp, this extremely light-bodied wine combines fruit from various vineyards and clones, and offers a suggestion of cranberry and pomegranate. Earthy, with an edge of forest and tea, it finishes plainly.<br />points: 87","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Light flavors call up notes of toasted cracker and raspberry candy that are pleasant enough, but insubstantial. The addition of 3% Syrah to the blend may have helped to bump up the color, but this remains a rather thin and simple, quaffable wine.<br />points: 87","price:   35<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Firmly structured, with bitter black cherries, red berry fruits and concentrated but vibrant fruit.

Maybe, but not more than 3–4 years.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Very fresh, very raspberry, this wine opens gently with sweetness and roundness. The tannins do come into play, but ever so gently, a counterpoint to the sweet, fine fruits that dominate this attractive, relatively early drinking wine.<br />points: 89","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Aromas of baked sour cherry tart precede pleasing wafts of violet and lavender. From a vineyard planted largely to a field selection of the Swan clone, it offers an expected earthiness and spiciness that intrigues around a core of balanced tension between fruit, acid and oak.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture.<br />points: 90","price:   22<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains.<br />points: 90","price:   23<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Very deep purple for a rosé, although still transparent, this could be mistaken for a light red wine. That's also true for the aromas that include cherry pie, cola and a light dusting of clove. There is a tangy tension to the sip, then flavors of baked red cherry, pastry crust and more clove. It's rather delicious, but a tad heavy for a pink wine.<br />points: 87","price:  100<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Slightly overripe cherry, prune and raisin aromas lead to a full plump palate. This is dark, dense in body and moderate in terms of acidity and structure. Ripe berry flavors end loamy but short. Drink now. Tasted twice with inconsistent results—this note mostly reflects the better of the two wines tasted.<br />points: 87","price:   22<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Very light and reserved on the nose at first whiff, this wine eventually allows aromas of smoked pork, red cherry and a light dusting to dried herbs to emerge. The palate is also delicate with cranberry and peppery herbs, making for an easy, engaging if not overly complex sipper.<br />points: 87","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Cherry, strawberry and baking spices combine in this medium-bodied wine that offers texture and soft, supple layers of refreshing acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   10<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food.<br />points: 84","price:   80<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Different vintages favor different sites, and this Goosepen Block offering, though perfectly made, is not quite as dense the other vintage offerings from Sokol Blosser. A wash of milk chocolate surrounds raspberry and cherry fruit. Smooth and supple, with a streak of cola and red licorice, it fades gently into a finish tinged with flavors of clay.<br />points: 90","price:   44<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated.

Balanced, the wine's acidity remains remarkably bright.<br />points: 90","price:   22<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Carbonic maceration is the fermentation technique employed in this wine. It brings out vibrant Bing-cherry flavors and with a hint of bread dough. There are interesting highlights of cured meats also.

Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait.<br />points: 92","price:   69<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Estates Reserve is a barrel selection combining chosen lots from the three estate vineyards. Despite this vintage's reputation for offering ripe, forward, accessible flavors, this wine remains stubbornly closed. It's entirely possible that it has just hit a bit of a dumb phase, which is not uncommon for recently-bottled Pinot Noir. Ripe full-bodied flavors of strawberry preserves peek through, with moderating acids and no herbal notes.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Directly adjoining the famed Shea Vineyard, these grapes bring comparable quality. This is young, grapy and aromatic, with primary aromas focused on black-cherry fruit. There are streaks of licorice and cola, leading into a long, lemony, tobacco-laced finish.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The wine from this vineyard has a lightly smoky scent, more of the characteristic tobacco aromas, and a flavorful fruit mix of mulberry, blueberry and blackberry. It's spicy and chunky and generous, ready for near-term drinking.<br />points: 92","price:   43<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Wood aging has imparted a slight bitterness to the ripe fruit. The juicy red-cherry flavor is melded into the firm tannins, and the finish is bright and round.<br />points: 88","price:   32<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Givry, which is located in the Côte Chalonnaise, produces wines that have warmth and a firm edge. This wine fits the style with its juicy red fruits, ripe tannins and solid, chunky finish. This is not for aging, so drink now.<br />points: 88","price:   62<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light, quiet layers of spice persist in this elegant, soft yet refined wine. Rose petal, orange, cherry and rhubarb flavors provide subtle fruitiness, supported by vibrant acidity and unobtrusive oak.<br />points: 91","price:   42<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This bright, focused wine with tense acidity blends fruit from five vineyards across the appellation. Silky tannins enwrap its nuanced dark cherry and wild strawberry flavors tinged with earth.<br />points: 91","price:   49<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This pretty Pinot offers ripe fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. There's a nice dash of chocolate and a supple, seamless mouthfeel, with all the components beautifully integrated.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Three-fifths was whole-cluster fermented, and the wine spent 18 months in 20% new French oak. This bottling amplifies the house style, which favors ripe, concentrated flavors of strawberry and raspberry fruit, adding highlights of chocolate and espresso. A whiff of dried straw wraps this up.<br />points: 91","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a fruity mix of sweet berries, with a streak of ripe orange. In both nose and mouth an almost delicate earthiness can be noticed, with suggestions of dried leaves.<br />points: 91","price:   38<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  There's a compelling feral quality to this complex bottling, starting with hints of game on the nose, alongside wild thyme, red cherry, asphalt and rose scents. Hearty sagebrush flavors fuel the palate, where tangy pomegranate and raspberry flavors play with the roasted game component.<br />points: 91","price:   85<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character.<br />points: 90","price:   10<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A minty strangeness permeates this wine, which comes off as artificial in flavor. Rumblings of cherry grenadine try to emerge from the muddled midpalate, which otherwise lacks flavor. The quick finish is medicinal and sweet.<br />points: 82","price:   30<br />points: 80<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine is flawed, with rustic leathery undertones that veer into Band-Aid, and an intensely sour note. Multiple bottles tried over several months.<br />points: 80","price:   17<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Firesteed's value-oriented Pinot is a solid and reliable wine that varies little from vintage to vintage. Flavors of rhubarb and strawberry are set in place with a touch of vanilla wafer. Don't cellar this. It's ready to go.<br />points: 87","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is well made, in a light, pale, tart style. The ample acidity boosts sour cherry fruit, keeping the wine sporty and fresh. It would make a fine match to salmon or turkey.<br />points: 87","price:   17<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rounded aromas of baked strawberry, red plum and a touch of graphite show on the nose of this always-solid offering for everyday sipping. Black raspberry and dried sagebrush make for a compelling palate that finishes on a touch of caramel.<br />points: 87","price:   62<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Soft and opulent, relishing its rich fruits and round, velvet structure, this wine hits all the right notes. It's not all padded and soft: There are tannins there, wrapped in the richness and delicious fruit.<br />points: 91","price:   33<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  For a winemaking family from the Loire, it must be a delight to work in Marlborough's almost unfailing sunshine. This is a medium-bodied, silky Pinot with scents of compost. Add that gentle earthiness to black cherry fruit, hints of herb and cola and the result is a winning combination. Drink 2018–2025.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Supple and full-bodied, this wine offers ample aromas and flavors of ripe cherries, supported by hints of cedar and vanilla. It's not super complex, but is a bold, flavorful wine with a softly dusty, lingering finish.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  From the Hahn family of wines comes this solid representation of the appellation, with dark cherry, wet slate and soft mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and comforting, with tight raspberry fruit and a clove-like spice note carrying through the entire sip, culminating in a mouthwatering black-pepper finish.<br />points: 92","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Somewhat lean in texture but very tasty and classic in terms of aroma and flavor, this wine has a unique presence. Aromas suggest rhubarb, raspberry and black tea, and the flavors reflect that complexity, too. At less than half the price of Hirsch's higher-priced wines, it has almost as much charm.<br />points: 90","price:   65<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind. With patience, it unpeels layers of soft, floral aromas and quiet notions of raspberry and strawberry.<br />points: 91","price:   59<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From the famous vineyard site along Westside Road, equally known for its Chardonnay, this big, bold red is not for the faint of heart. It delivers a powerful punch of voluptuously jammy blueberry around soft, earthy wisps of forest and black tea.<br />points: 91","price:   48<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This delicious bottle sings out with a burst of bright raspberry fruit. As with all the Winderlea designates, the exposure to new oak is fairly minimal—just 10 months in one-sixth new barrels. Juicy acidity keeps flavors buoyant, and the barrels add light notes of caramel and nougat. Drink this with great enjoyment over the next two or three years.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Estate grown and fermented with native yeasts, the Select cuvée is the entry level offering from Brick House. In this hot vintage the picking, sorting and fermentation have been carefully managed to produce a balanced and textural wine. The fruit shines through with apple, cranberry and cherry, underscored by a refreshing minerality. The acids have a subtle citrus/orange peel flavor.<br />points: 91","price:   65<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A depth of earth and sassafras make for sultry companions in this vineyard designate, marked by heady aromas of roses. Soft and subtle on the palate, with a lightness and elegance, it lingers in pomegranate, raspberry and black tea.<br />points: 91","price:   17<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Stiff and fairly tannic, this includes some fruit from Oregon's tiny Red Hill AVA. Brambly wild berry highlights, bright and firm, lead into a finish annotated with baking chocolate.<br />points: 87","price:   43<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Approachable with pretty cherry and rose petal flavors, this wine finds its spine via a streak of herb and tannin. Dried leaves, a hint of granite, and persistent berry flavors suggest that it can be cellared for at least 6–8 years.<br />points: 87","price:   42<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This impressive wine is tangy in cherry, cranberry and evocative peels of orange zest that possess concentrated tannin and weight while maintaining a baseline of positive acidity.

It picks up fresh blackberry fruit and a lick of licorice as it powers through to a polished and persistent finish.<br />points: 91","price:   65<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone. The flavors persist along that path, crafting a sleek and distinctive wine that in many ways is the antithesis of the fleshy, jammy, fruit-forward style of many domestic Pinots.<br />points: 91","price:   24<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Sourced from two vineyards, including Sangiacomo Amaral Ranch, a cool site near the bay, this is a tremendous offering for the price. The wine is light, bright and brambly in raspberry and cherry kirsch, with a mischievous streak of cola. Pretty and fresh, it finishes in a tease of black tea.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Full-figured tannins wrap luxuriously around textured layers of cranberry and black cherry in this blockbuster wine. A subtle minerality forms in the background, represented best by the taste of orange peel, before it finishes densely concentrated. Drink now through 2021.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  An enticing cedar and cinnamon aroma leads to robust spiced plum flavors and a lively combination of fine tannins and good acidity for balance. This is a bold, flavorful and ripe-tasting wine that also stays poised and appetizing. Not shabby at all and it should improve through at least 2020.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's an exotic perfumey-ness to this wine that almost suggests patchouli, so relaxed and complex it is. Medium-bodied with an inviting layering of black cherry and stemmy earthiness, it's curiously riddled in white pepper as it finishes.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Dark in color and flavor, the Crannell brings ripe fruit flavors of black cherry and prune.

Feels correct and well-balanced, with honest Pinot flavors of red fruits, herbs and baked earth. Tastes and feels harmonious.<br />points: 89","price:   44<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Villa's Seddon vineyard is located in the Awatere Valley—a Marlborough subregion that's generally cooler than the main valley. As a result, this is a slightly lighter, more herbal rendering of Pinot Noir, but one that avoids any overt greenness or astringency. It's complex, elegant and silky—just like more Pinots should be.<br />points: 92","price:   27<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This lower alcohol-style wine from the biodynamic-minded producer shows cranberry, orange rinds, chaparral scrub, dried oregano and a mix of green and kalamata olives on the nose. It's very savvy on the palate, with minced parsley, olive tapenade, cracked peppercorns and caper berries, all framed by mouth-watering acidity.<br />points: 92","price:   52<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Subtle aromatics of earthy rose petal surround this silky, light wine, steeped in acidity and a damp-forested quality. Spicy throughout in cinnamon, cardamom and grated nutmeg, the wine picks up a girth of thickness on the finish, a knot of tannin that gives it a swath of complexity and cellaring possibilities, through 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   44<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This producer is honing in on the unconventional, sourcing Pinot Noir grapes from unlikely Napa Valley spots like Spring Mountain and Atlas Peak. The resulting wines are surprising and unpredictable in their complexity of savory blithe spirit, light and clear with edgy red cherry and tea, plenty structured, with lurking tannin. The floral aspect on the nose is compelling, as is the cardamon finish.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Made from a barrel selection of Keefer Ranch grapes, this wine flirts in juicy grenadine and red licorice on the nose, before developing into a more complex expression of supple tannins and likable acidity.

With just a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg, it develops spiciness on the palate, finishing light and bright.<br />points: 92","price:   40<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Winemaker Justin Mund worked at Laetitia for four years, so he knows the blocks, and picks this one well. The nose shows blackberry fruit but the unique parts are the beef blood and gamy pork aromas. It's sanguine on the palate at first, then opens to Bing cherries and eucalyptus oil.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Wild berry and vanilla rise to the fore on this rose-petal-piqued vineyard-designate, the site planted by this producer. There's some girth on the midpalate, and depth of flavor, along with a supportive structure of oak and tannin, the entirety teased in complexity. It finishes juicy and refreshing in pomegranate, wild mushroom and spice.<br />points: 92","price:   75<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This powerful, dense wine has a good, long journey to travel. The 20% wood aging has given a surprising amount of toastiness to the black plum fruit and intense acidity. It needs to age, so drink from 2020.<br />points: 92","price:   30<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With spice and dark coffee flavors, this wine shows some wood aging. It also has considerable acidity and the brightest strawberry fruit. Lively and fragrant at the end, it can be drunk now.<br />points: 88","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Full of red fruits, it also has a strong structure and firm tannins. For now, the wine is textured and dense. It needs to age and broaden out to give a softer feeling. Drink from 2018.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A perfumed wine, it's very fresh and bright with strawberry flavors as well as a delicate touch of tannin. A delicious wine to drink now.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  The color is on the light side, with a garnet to brick hue. Intriguing aromas of forest floor, tobacco and black cherry waft out of the glass. Rich flavors suggest dark fruits, clove, cola and anise, and the texture is simultaneously generous and firmly tannic. Very complex and well balanced overall, it is just nicely medium bodied.<br />points: 92","price:   85<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Showing a light whiff of funk, this seems a bit reductive at first, but opens gracefully with adequate aeration.

This accent is welcome and yet risks getting overcome by the ripeness of fruit.<br />points: 87","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Young, bright raspberry fruit brings fresh, forward flavors front and center. There's a touch of cherry Popsicle also.

It will be ready to drink from 2017.<br />points: 87","price:   60<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's a basket of ripe raspberry and strawberry in this earthy, single-vineyard designated wine, an earthiness that doesn't let go. Truffle and damp forest meet in the middle to introduce dusty, dense tannins that will benefit from time and air.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Drinkable now, this wine opens with a syrupy grenadine aroma that rises to the top, followed by enjoyable layers of black cherry, mushroomy earth and silky, smooth tannins.

In a world where so many Oregon wineries are making Pinot Noir that is superripe, extracted and alcoholic, this shows why the Burgundy comparison is still valid.<br />points: 86","price:   18<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is 100% Pinot Noir, tart and young and juicy, and at this price it's a pretty fair value.

It opens juicy and exuberant, almost brawny, in black cherry and berry. Oak, currant and clove provide a spicy flair midway through and on the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Less complex than some of Londer's single-vineyard designates, this is a great value Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.

The wine has power and density, with black fruits that show sweetness. It will be delicious but the structure does need to soften first. Drink from 2017.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Dark burgundy in color, it has an old-world soul, earthy and brooding in clove, mushroomy forest floor and a light texture of cherry, not what you'd expect from a big-time NASCAR guy.

The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate.

The palate brings in accents of iron filings, mushroom and further complexity. It's a sturdy, medium-weight, earthy wine, with moderate aging potention. Drink now through 2023.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a rather tense, tightly wound wine, offering tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Tangy, juicy acidity keeps flavors fresh and forward, with a mineral underpinning.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  From a warm site, this shows warm, ripe round flavors of lush strawberry and cherry. It plays out broadly across the palate, retaining its focus in a medium-long follow-through. It's perfect for near-term drinking.<br />points: 91","price:   32<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This excellent entry-level Pinot is bursting with a delightful bouquet of cherries and white chocolate. It's crisp and direct, with well-defined raspberry fruit at the core. The finish is a little stiff and tight, but unpacks well with ample aeration.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Situated in the McMinnville AVA, this vineyard delivers a sleek, well-proportioned wine. Though tight and unyielding at first, it is aromatically promising, with a mix of rose petals, berries and chocolate. Those flavors expand as it breathes open, finishing with the AVA's characteristic gun-metal minerality. Drink 2018–2028.<br />points: 91","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The spare red fruit seems set in stone. The AVA's characteristic sub-flavors of concrete and dry stone are on full display. The wine remains tightly wound, with crisp definition. This should benefit from another couple of years in bottle. It finishes with plenty of acid and chalk.<br />points: 89","price:   70<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from a single block, this is a tart wine with delicate fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. It does not have the depth nor stuffing of the previous vintage. Some pleasant aromatics of orange peel and citrus add interest.<br />points: 89","price:   80<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This spent 18 months in French oak and three years in bottle, ahead of an April 2016 release. Light and elegant, it carries a whiff and taste of leather, with earthy, slightly grainy tannins. With air, the strawberry fruit gains some flesh. Decant it and drink now through 2018.<br />points: 89","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is smoky, ripe and packed with tannins. The fruit gives the wine weight although it is not yet fully developed. There is a toasty background to this rich wine with its juicy red-berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2019.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The fourth-generation family behind San Antonio Winery make this top-end bottling from the vineyard they planted. Aromas of dark red fruit, heavy black spice, tar and smoke hit the nose with promising force, but the palate proves quite tannic with sour and bitter cranberry skins. This has all the elements needed for a classic wine, but give till 2016.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Scents and flavors of sandalwood and root beer come up first, with strawberry and cherry fruit following. Sourced principally from Winter's Hill vineyard, it's a gentle wine that gains momentum through the finish. Slightly reductive burnt rubber notes come in late, but with vigorous aeration the flavors smooth out.<br />points: 88","price:   48<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This estate-grown wine is made by Ken Wright. Showing some sharp, high-toned volatility in the nose, it opens into a smooth, spicy wine with pomegranate and black cherry fruit. A slight whiff of vinegar underlies the tannins, but for most tasters, it will not be noticeable.<br />points: 88","price:   58<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A very elegant and refined Evenstad Reserve, with grace notes of sandalwood and a lovely cherry core. The fruit is immaculate, the concentration focused and lengthy, and the flavors are so artfully blended that the wine is seamless and perfectly balanced. Although it is drinking like a mature wine, there is every reason to cellar wines such as this—it can develop like a fine Burgundy, over decades.<br />points: 95","price:   20<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This expands the winery's portfolio with a nod to the $20 pricepoint that's become a defining limit to affordable Oregon Pinot. This wine is hard, slightly burnt and bitter in the finish, with simple candy cherry-fruit flavors.<br />points: 85","price:   15<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.<br />points: 90","price:   39<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Despite the effects of a cool year, this wine is still enjoyable. Its cherry fruit is tinged with notes of root vegetables and beet greens, and while there's ample weight, the tannins are just a touch drying on the finish.<br />points: 87","price:   15<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Earthy plum, forest floor and mushroom form a funky outline of this wine, before it expands into crisp red cherry, rhubarb and a wisp of sassafras. Medium-bodied, it finishes lean in acidity on the finish.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Still quite young, but showing real depth and layering, the McCrone vineyard designate offers pomegranate and raspberry fruit, dusted with baking spices, and finished with a tasty vein of mocha. This is a wine to enjoy in the full bloom of its youth.<br />points: 92","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. Along with sweet cherry fruit comes a defining minerality—a streak of iron running through the heart of the wine. Balanced nicely, with gentle acidity and sculpted tannins. In the finish you pick up an elegant streak of green tea.<br />points: 91","price:   75<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This opens with a very pretty nose—scents of clay, mineral, blueberry, cassis and a whiff of rather high-toned volatility. In the mouth the barrel flavors bring dusty cocoa and chocolate. A full-bodied wine, still young, sharp and edgy. Best to give it a few more years in the cellar, to smooth out some of the rawness.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.<br />points: 91","price:   45<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.<br />points: 91","price:   45<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tart, tangy, and herbal, this juicy wine mixes cranberry and strawberry fruit with tomato leaf, herb and peppery spice. If new oak barrels were used, they are not showing themselves at the moment. But the balance, length and detail are delightful.<br />points: 91","price:   48<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Generally considered the best of the best single vineyard Pinots from Sineann, this new Resonance is—to quote the late, great Robert Palmer—simply irresistible. Fresh fruit flavors of strawberry, raspberry, sweet cherry and more roll into a lingering aftermath with nuances of cinnamon, cola, chocolate, nougat, coconut and caramel. None of this is overwhelming; the fruit rules. But the finesse and length, which sneaks up on you, are impressive.<br />points: 94","price:   40<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Light and murky, with a flavor mix of tomato, vegetable juice, celery, barely ripe berries and thin acids. That sounds worse than it is; taste this alongside a Bourgogne from a big shipper in a cool vintage and you wouldn't see much difference. The alcohol here is listed at just 12.5%. It's a serviceable everyday wine, but not priced accordingly.<br />points: 85","price:   33<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This finely balanced, juicy wine is full of red-fruit aromas and brisk acidity. Juicy and bright with strawberry flavors and refreshing acidity, it's a value wine with great potential.

Firm, ripe tannins suggest a sturdy wine ready for the cellar, which nonetheless lets the fruit shine through the peppery finish.<br />points: 91","price:   70<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the winery's reserve bottling, representing the best five barrels of the vintage. Supple and refined, it frames its young berry fruit flavors in elegant tannins. Nicely focused and still a bit raw, this wine will reward some further years of aging.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The fruit is sourced from Mark Ryan-designated rows in the Lachini Vineyard. Fermented with native yeast in stainless steel, and aged in 50% new French oak, this opens with plenty of green tea-flavored tannins, and an undercurrent of earth and wood, but the Pinot fruit shines through and expands, with notes of cola, cherry fruit and a streak of iron.<br />points: 91","price:   10<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Flat and somewhat disjointed, this wine offers a strong taste of eucalyptus in a light-bodied, simply structured frame.<br />points: 82","price:   15<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This medium-bodied wine has a light color, earthy and herbal scents, a tart cherry flavor and a dry finish.<br />points: 82","price:   60<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Thick tannins obscure some of the richer flavors trying to burst through in this wine, a mix of blackberry, black olive and cedar. Full bodied and generous in every way, it finishes with a slow drag of smoke.<br />points: 88","price:   14<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A straightforward, well-priced wine with hints of cola spice, dark cherry and strawberry vanilla that'll go down easy and pair with all kinds of lighter fare. Made from organic grapes.<br />points: 86","price:   14<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Soft red fruits dominate this only lightly structured wine. It is more about juicy Pinot Noir, fruity with raspberry and red-currant flavors. Dryness at the core of the wine adds shape. The wine is ready to drink.<br />points: 86","price:   40<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This new Pinot is quite light in color, and hits the palate with a mix of tart cranberry and bitter herb. In 2012, a fruit-forward vintage, it seems slightly underripe, and thins out quickly.<br />points: 86","price:   85<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018.<br />points: 90","price:   25<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Tense with acidity and dense in firm tannins, this fun, affordable wine needs time to unwind after opening. Once aired, it shares notes of black tea, licorice and a twine of leather around thick, shy fruit, most notably cranberry.<br />points: 90","price:   80<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though the vintage helped create a lighter-than-usual version of this benchmark Pinot, it's beautifully crafted and fully realized. Like Burgundy, it disguises its power in a framework of elegantly defined fruits, acids and polished tannins. Cherry, plum, peach pit, pineapple and lemon oil notes are all in the mix. It's a wine that invites contemplation and rewards your time and attention.<br />points: 93","price:   58<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A stunning return to the quality that was seen in 2008, this superb effort bursts onto the palate with brambly berries, sweet herbs, coffee grounds and somewhat stiff, but polished, tannins. It's complex, with a touch of earthiness and generous length. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA.<br />points: 93","price:   52<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The best of a very fine flight of 2010 Pinots from Rex Hill, the La Colina offers a succulent mix of crushed flower, berry and liquid rock. The flavors meld beautifully, with vivid, lively acidity that brings a touch of grapefruit. The label reads Willamette Valley, though the vineyard is in the Dundee Hills AVA.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  With its built-in ageability and instant flavor appeal, this bottling may be the favorite of all the 2010s from Bergström. It's complete and delicious, with muscle and depth—a mouth-pleasing mix of berry, cola, sandalwood and earth, plus exotic accents of incense and myrrh.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit.

It's medium bodied, with a slightly open-knit but soft texture. Drink now–2016.<br />points: 88","price:   59<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light and clear in color and texture, this wine opens in dirt and earth, along with a touch of baked strawberry. Smooth, juicy and long-lasting, it shows off the vintage's warmer leanings, and is medium bodied and densely lengthy.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Marked by crunchy, just-ripe cherry fruit and some slightly herbal shadings, this nonetheless offers solid value.

Hints of campfire and button mushrooms add welcome complexity, ending on a long, mouthwatering note of tart fruit.<br />points: 88","price:   52<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A field of mint is found on the nose of this soft, spicy wine with the gimmicky name, around a core of red cherry and touch of oak. Fresh and bright, it has a suggestion of heft on the finish.<br />points: 88","price:   16<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a solid effort, especially at this price point. The cherry-cola core of flavor grabs your interest quickly, and hangs on with a hint of tobacco in the smooth finish. Some nice acidity adds a touch of minerality.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The 2010 BlackJack is loaded with tart cranberry and pomegranate fruit flavors. There is a streak of iron and darker notes that come through in earthy, slighted roasted tannins. The complexity is intriguing and adds depth to a rather light vintage.<br />points: 90","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A structured wine, packed with red fruits and delightful acidity. There is a core of dark tannin and a solid structure as well as the bright freshness at the end. Because it has this structure, it's worth aging for 4–5 years.<br />points: 90","price:   48<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Following in the wake of the marvelously ripe 2009 Tendril, this does not carry the same weight and authority. It's well made and accurately reflects the cooler, difficult vintage. Strawberry fruit is lightly coated in chocolaty tannins; the wine remains firm and compact, with medium body and balance throughout.<br />points: 89","price:   17<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A lightly perfumed wine, this is soft with warm strawberry flavors.

It's ready to drink.<br />points: 85","price:   23<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Tannins and a red berry flavor combine in this soft wine. It has the structure of the vintage, with a firm core; the fruit and acidity developing slowly. Keep for 2–3 years.<br />points: 86","price:   24<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Surprisingly mature in both color and flavor development, this mixes a flavor of rhubarb pie with brown sugar accents. Soft and approachable in style this should be consumed soon.<br />points: 86","price:   18<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Pretty ripe stuff, marked by hints of stewed berries and chocolate.

Aromas of red cherry, red plum, vanilla bean, wet slate, rose hips and a touch of fennel pop on the nose. The palate shows underripe cherry that's spiced by white pepper, dill, bay leaf, peppercorns and eucalyptus oil.<br />points: 92","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From the Sebastopol Hills neighborhood, relatively cool and wind-affected, this wine has a compelling generosity, a full-bodied concentration that never gets bogged down.

Brief barrel aging has added a touch of chocolate around the tannins.<br />points: 91","price:   48<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Another excellent vintage from Saffron Fields, under the guiding hand of veteran winemaker Tony Rynders. Buoyed by aging in 50% new French oak, it's got more flesh than most Pinots from this cool vintage, along with generous amounts of sweet spices and barrel toast. The red fruits and complementary acidity are also here in abundance.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Coming from the dramatic Lindsay's Vineyard, which rises from 500 to 1,000 feet in the Sta. Rita Hills, this highly nuanced wine overdelivers on multiple fronts. The nose mixes floral notes of violet and rose with an herbal tone of dried oregano, alongside fruity sour cherry. On the palate, there's graphite, espresso, purple flowers like lavender and a tad of tobacco, both fresh and smoked.<br />points: 91","price:   44<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A sly, subtle wine delicate in profile and character, this has acidity as its main star, and also playing a few supporting parts. Rhubarb, cranberry and orange lie atop more savory specks of cardamom and tea.<br />points: 90","price:   44<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Rhubarb, strawberries and a strong streak of citrus and orange peel are the dominant flavors here.

Tannins are ripe and proportionate.<br />points: 87","price:   60<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Among the early releases of the 2011 single-vineyard Pinots from Torii Mor, the Olson seems to be the one that had the most difficulty achieving full ripeness. Scents and flavors are focused upon green tea, peppery herbs, even a suggestion of fiddlehead ferns. The fruit reaches rhubarb-level ripeness and remains there, but the balance and structure are first-rate.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  These are the oldest Pinot vines on the property, planted in 1999. A mix of Pommard, Wadenswil and Dijon clones, they create a rather sharp, herbal wine, with earthy tannins and a hint of bitterness. Barrel aging adds some baking chocolate flavors, but additional bottle age is recommended.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This barrel selection actually was given less exposure to new French oak than the estate bottling, a telling fact, which demonstrates Anam Cara's commitment to fruit and terroir. Elegant and charming, it links pomegranate, raspberry and cherry fruit to silky tannins, achieving a lovely purity of expression in a year of moderate ripeness.<br />points: 89","price:   80<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Christmas-like aromas of juniper, pine and forest floor hit the nose hard on this bottling from the historic vineyard, all leveled by fresh squeezed pomegranate juice, wild sweet mint and pencil shavings. A woody character reminiscent of uncured sandalwood powers the palate, which also shows cranberry juice and pipe tobacco in the background.<br />points: 93","price:   48<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Elegance is a hallmark of the winery's Pinots, and even this one, registering 15% alcohol, manages to keep from tasting overblown. It's thick and rich, for sure, loaded with cherry and plum fruit, with pepper, clay, Asian spices and dark chocolate. Lazy River is one of the components of the Winemaker's Cuvée, which is a lovely comparison companion bottle.<br />points: 93","price:   35<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The winery's multiple vineyard designates are very good, but the blending that goes into this Winemaker's Cuvée puts it right there with the best of them. Bursting with blueberry, cherry and plum scents and flavors, this complex and complete wine piles on the details.

Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.<br />points: 86","price:  130<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  For a Volnay, this is a very structured wine.

There's lots to enjoy here—hints of spice, earth, even hemp, along with the core fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry. It's just a little thinner than usual in this new vintage.<br />points: 90","price:   36<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This Marin County Pinot may have suffered from the cool vintage as the raspberry and cherry flavors that it opens with veer into bitter territory.

The black cherry core is so intense it veers into cassis, with veins of espresso, Kahlúa and cacao. It's a powerful wine, perfectly framed and balanced by ripe tannins. It's ready to drink now, but certainly a wine you may confidently cellar for at least another decade.<br />points: 94","price:   95<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.<br />points: 94","price:   80<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Bliss Block lies within the property's Quail Hill Vineyard and is the coolest two acres on the estate.

It is tightly wound on the sip, with cranberry, raspberry, rose petal and rose-hip flavors. The texture and tension are impressive, and will unleash continued intrigue from 2018 to 2033.<br />points: 94","price:   55<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  From the oldest part of the estate, planted in 1992, this excellent effort seems to have entered the phase where more aromatic complexity appears. It has lovely delineation of both scents and flavors, a matrix of fruit, soil and Pommard clone. Strong streaks of tobacco and chocolate annotate the core of raspberry puree. The concentration and length are impressive.<br />points: 94","price:   62<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a spicy, fully plush and complete wine, integrated in oak and tannin with a strength of black-cherry compote that gives an extra edge.

It reigns in ripeness without sacrificing flavor or complexity. Stemmy, earthy overtones meet a vibrantly spicy bite of cherry and white pepper. The silky texture compels one to want more.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is the producer's first vintage from Hudson, one of the most sought-after sites in the appellation, and one not widely planted to the variety. Light and lush with a velvety ripeness, this special wine shines in pomegranate, earthy truffle and a turn of smoked meat. Robust, it maintains balance amidst its brawn.<br />points: 93","price:   17<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A pale and delicate version of this entry-level Pinot, its fruit is barely there, just hinting at rhubarb and watermelon. Some earth and stem flavors come through as well.<br />points: 85","price:   50<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  There is a light suggestion of barely ripe strawberry and strawberry leaf, followed by flavors that are more tomatoey than grapy.<br />points: 85","price:   22<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Winemaker Adam Lee notes that only two Oregon Pinots were made in 2011, as all fruit was declassified. Indeed, this is a thin, peppery wine, with highlights of orange peel and grapefruit, and just a short slice of red berry fruit.<br />points: 85","price:   35<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A smoky, oaky nose opens to reveal pretty fruit, accented with rose petals.

The fruit rolls from cranberry to strawberry to cherry, and the wine has a slightly woody character. Tannins are proportionate, still a bit stiff, and showing leafy notes. A light suggestion of chocolate infuses the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Cloudy and reddish-brown, this is a funky, spritzy wine with a taste of red cherry that falls somewhat flat on the finish.<br />points: 84","price:   42<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A dark color and candied, pruney aromas give way to jammy black cherry flavors and a lightly tannic texture. This is tart and medium bodied, with straightforward ripe flavors.<br />points: 84","price:   20<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Rather aggressive tannins and distinctly earthy scents of tomato leaf and vegetation characterize this modest effort.

Owners James Hahn and Mila Chanamé are childhood friends with longtime Anderson Valley vineyard manager Norman Kobler and the shared roots have clearly put them in sync. The wine is perfumey in lilac and violet with a lightly textured and seductive mouthfeel that's exotic in just-ripe cherry and raspberry.<br />points: 94","price:   58<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From one of Marin's coolest and best-farmed vineyard sites, this offering is intoxicatingly pretty in violets and herbs, and fleshy in the mouth with gorgeous texture.

In the mouth it turns astringent, carrying similar flavors into a finish with a liberal amount of stem and earth.<br />points: 87","price:   44<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  From a series of single-clone, single-block bottlings, this is a sharp-toned, slightly volatile wine with bright, tight, cherry fruit flavors. It's a good starting point for a blend, but feels incomplete on its own.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine is unquestionably about power and punch, not subtlety. Superripe fruit flavors of kirsch and dark, toasty, coffee liqueur coat the palate.

Red and black fruits penetrate into a silky, spicy, supple core. It's a bit lower in alcohol than most of the other single vineyard Pinots from Erath, but all the more cellar-worthy.<br />points: 93","price:   50<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Ripe, full-bodied black cherry fruit shines here, with good tannin support.

Crisp apple and sliced Meyer lemon flavors show on the palate, where the bubbles are foamy, the yeast is present but restrained and the style is very approachable.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A round, fruit-powered, appealing mix of delicious citrus, berry and plum flavors. Highlights of orange peel and baking spices are underscored by bracing acidity. Sourced entirely from the Clawson Creek estate vineyard.<br />points: 90","price:   44<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.<br />points: 92","price:   20<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  At 62,000-plus cases, you are in the land of the seamless blend. Oregon does not have vast contiguous vineyards, so these grapes must have come from here, there and everywhere. The result is a gentle, lightly fruity, crisp, clean and innocuous Pinot Noir that lacks only a sense of place.<br />points: 85","price:   20<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This would be easy to mistake for Grenache—it's ruby-colored, cranberry-flavored, with hints of strawberry and licorice. Clean, crisp and noticeably acidic, it would be most enjoyable with a richly sauced breast of duck.<br />points: 85","price:   45<br />points: 81<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Leather and dust, with thin raspberry fruit that is pretty well buried under the barnyard flavors.<br />points: 81","price:   78<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Chock-a-block full of strawberry, black cherry and a sliver of orange peel, this wine is big-boned, well-structured and fleshy. Mouthfilling and juicy, the palate shows touches of black tea and tobacco, making for a lively tension between the earthiness and exuberance of fruit. Drink now through 2022.<br />points: 95","price:   36<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Wy'east is better than ever in this vintage, a divine balancing act with berry, plum, Asian spices and chocolate all in focus. From the opening scents, laden with complex and perfectly fused notes of blackberry, mineral, coriander and cacao, right on through the extended, captivating finish, this is a wine that is almost impossible to put down, yet will drink well at least through 2025.<br />points: 95","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This bottling spent 20 months in French oak (30% new), and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards. Superripe aromas and flavors conjure up a rich and riveting mix of black cherry with amaro-like botanical nuances. This profound wine is already irresistible, but stash a few bottles in your cellar, to drink now through 2030.<br />points: 94","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Tart cherry meets with woody charred-cedar spice, dried earth and crushed rocks on the nose of this appellation blend. The lightly bodied sip offers flavors that are quite light, with evenly dispersed cherry and gravel.<br />points: 88","price:   23<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine's plum and Bing cherry flavors glide smoothly through the midpalate with moderate density. It was sourced from own-rooted vines from a half dozen vineyards, notably Temperance Hill and Sunnyside.<br />points: 88","price:   37<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This bottling comes from the winery's Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard near the town of Sonoma, planted to eight separate Pinot Noir blocks. Savory in cranberry and cassis and quite austere, it's balanced in aromas of rose petal and a taste of black tea. Tannins are ripe yet firm, providing structure to help age the wine further.<br />points: 88","price:   36<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Oaky, spicy and tannic, this is showing some sharp edges around moderately ripe plum and cherry fruit. It's solid and substantial, a bit blocky, and currently showing more barrel influence than fruit. All estate fruit, 40% new French oak. Additional bottle age might improve the score.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Tohu's latest Pinot Noir boasts somewhat simple cherry and charred-oak flavors but decent weight and texture, with some fine-grained tannins on the finish.

The flavors are delicate, with a sparse plum-fruit backbone lifted by strong herbal components of tarragon, marjoram, pepper and a bit of juniper.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This seductive wine has a deep ruby color, jazzy cherry and plum aromas and an elegantly balanced mouthfeel. It offers plenty of fruit flavors that are fresh and just a touch tart like they should be, firm tannins and full body. Best after 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   42<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A light garnet color and layers of classic aromas like tea, rhubarb, cherry and a nice walk-in-the-pines element segue to gentle cherry, raspberry and black tea in this medium-bodied, elegant wine. It's also classic in the sense that complexity and drinkability rule over sheer power.<br />points: 92","price:   64<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  One of the four vineyards that this winery entirely uses as a monopole bottling, this wine shows smoked pork, baked raspberry, crushed rosebuds and a touch of sesame on the nose. The palate's backbone is a tangy cranberry fruit that is enhanced by pencil lead and cedar spice.<br />points: 92","price:   35<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Posh fruit aromas, gentle and ripe flavors and a very polished texture make this wine more fun to drink now than its big sister, the Ferrington single-vineyard Pinot. Delicious red cherry, cinnamon and cedar threads weave a complex and layered flavor, with a good underpinning of fine-grained tannins.<br />points: 92","price:   42<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A touch of new oak adds complexity and a good, gripping sensation to this medium-bodied and nicely structured wine. Adding to the light toast and smoke aromas, the fruit flavors bring tart cherry and raspberry plus some bass notes of clove and black tea. The wine has an appetizing balance and persistent flavors. It will be best after 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  The producer expertly captures the mix of coolness and intensity so true to the appellation, a tangle of brooding black cherry, blackberry and underlying smoke, that's both decadent and succulent on the palate, deeply satisfying in its finish of chocolate and black licorice.<br />points: 92","price:   42<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This small producer continues to impress with this floral, impressively made effort, sourced from several vineyards, including Terra de Promissio. Sly layers of raspberry define juicy acidity and sizable tannin and oak that support but don't intrude. The finish continues the theme of vibrancy, lingering in cherry and dried cranberry.<br />points: 92","price:   18<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Strong aromas and flavors like smoke and bacon seem heavy in this medium-bodied but tannic wine. A dish with bacon might bring it around.<br />points: 84","price:   45<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Rough, sinewy and oaky, this full-bodied wine is concentrated and thick, a robust expression of bitter black fruit and leather.<br />points: 84","price:   26<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a rough, rustic, country red, with little varietal character and none of the elegance of Pinot Noir. Tart, light strawberry fruit is smothered in chewy, earthy tannins.<br />points: 84","price:   73<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Proper Nuits-St.-Georges, all dry tannins powering through the dark cherry fruit flavors, and balanced with tasty acidity. There's great potential here, the ripe fruits just showing their intensity, but for the moment, the tannins are the core.<br />points: 90","price:   33<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  An opulent style, where the tannins are subservient to the ripeness of the red cherry flavor. The acidity enhances the sweetness of the rich fruit, and the lively, vibrant texture comes sweeping right through to finish.<br />points: 90","price:  240<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance—the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Jerome reserve is exactly what you want and expect in a reserve. Not just bigger, not just more of everything—it has that—but without sacrificing terroir or balance. Supple, veined with red fruits, purple fruits, smoke, earth and barrel toast, the wine moves sinuously across the palate into a full-bore finish. Lots of life ahead.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Mirabelle is the darkest, chewiest, most tannic of the three clonal selection Pinots offered by Vidon. It's a Pinot in Cab clothing. Chewy, dense, ripe fruit keeps it all in proportion, a thick black cherry core with rings of chocolate. Think Saturn in a glass.<br />points: 92","price:   10<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  An inexpensive, large-production Pinot that's overly earthy and a little thin on the finish with a smidgen of residual sugar thrown in too, but reasonably priced and decently quaffable with food.<br />points: 84","price:   38<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Half of the wine was whole-cluster fermented, and only native yeast was employed. It's got a tart and tangy quality, with pure fruit flavors of cranberry, strawberry and raspberry. The acids are clean and the wine crisply refreshing.<br />points: 91","price:   75<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From the owners of another marquee vineyard nearby, Sun Chase, this wine is expressive and expansive on the palate, dark red-purple in color, thick and dense on the palate. Blackberry, black plum and black pepper rise to the fore, built along a continuum of earthy forest floor. Tannin and oak are interwoven well, before a soft finish.<br />points: 91","price:   66<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Aged in 100% once-filled barrels, this smooth and savory wine blends four different Dijon clones. The spicy raspberry and cherry fruit coats the tongue, wrapped in light caramel and toast. It's a very pretty, elegant wine, drinking nicely already, but one that should continue to hold together well through 2020.<br />points: 91","price:   54<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the most widely distributed, highest-production Pinot Noir from Archery Summit. It's forward and fruity, with generous, ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. There is a steely sheen to the finishing flavors, like licking a knife blade, and the tannins pack enough muscle to further improve the wine through 2018–2020.<br />points: 91","price:   85<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The fermentation with the stems intact brings some earthy qualities front and center, to good effect. This is the most distinctive entry among the winery's eight Pinots, further enhanced by the use of wild yeasts. Scents of clover and hints of watercress and bark highlight the flavors of beetroot and brambly berry fruit. You will have fun playing this against a variety of potential food matchups.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  One of the top Pinot rosés of the vintage, this is beautiful to look at, to sniff and to sip. The color of pale pink cherry blossoms, it matches rather delicate complexity to surprising concentration, pushing ripe cherry fruit front and center. It's finished dry, and should not be over-chilled, or you'll miss the lovely aromatics.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Smooth and silky, this seductive wine is absolutely loaded with flavors of cherry and chocolate. It's irresistible, and probably at or near its peak drinking window, as it affords maximum pleasure in a luscious, palate-coating style.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  If ripe, jammy fruit is what you like in an Oregon Pinot, this is your baby.

Aromas resemble red cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg, while the flavors are ripe and spread out on the palate, seeming to form layers of fruit, spice and maple. Smooth and flavorful, it's appealing from first sniff to finish.<br />points: 91","price:   36<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This sure-fire crowd pleaser opens with the steely authority of the AVA's Pinots, showing a streak of earth and bark. Then it fills in, with ripe purple fruit swathed in generous layers of coffee grounds and toasty oak. It finishes long and smoky, with plenty of power.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fully ripened in this exemplary vintage, this boasts fleshy cherry and plum fruit, with tasty confectionary highlights. Ten months aging in 25% new French oak contributes to those sweet notes, and a touch of sassafras and cola streaks across the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Bold and smoky, this offers tart, tight cherry and brambly berry fruit. The juicy acidity is counterpointed with a certain chalkiness. A whiff of truffle further complements the fruit. It's a sleek wine with surprising power.<br />points: 91","price:   38<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This lovely, luxurious wine hails from the Terra de Promissio Vineyard. It stands out for its thickness of earthy forest floor and exuberant fruit, a mix of candied raspberry, blueberry and cherry. Building structure and power as it opens in the glass, it finishes strongly tannic, suggesting more time in the cellar may be of benefit; hold through 2023.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  One of the Hahn family's top brands, this bottling shows cola, clove and dense cranberry juice aromas, offering dense yet tart red fruit against uncrushed spice. Mossy earth plays into the palate, where more dried cranberry notes mix with thyme, dried sage, juniper and eucalyptus.<br />points: 92","price:   64<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Woody aromatics of myrrh and frankincense meld with crushed cinnamon, condensed hibiscus, red berries and black pepper on the nose of this bottling. Black cherry shows at the tip of the sip, then drops into incense, pine and juniper flavors, revealing cola and coffee notes toward the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   49<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A full-bodied, complex and supple-textured wine, this offers plump, ripe black-cherry aromas shaded by hints of forest floor and sautéed mushrooms, along with mild plum and cherry flavors. While soft and soothing on the palate, a fine layer of tannins wraps it up and keeps it appetizing.<br />points: 92","price:   32<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements.<br />points: 92","price:   32<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Slightly reductive on the nose, this bottling from a very coastal vineyard outside of Cambria shows mossy forest floor, jerked meat, dried cranberries, turned earth, sesame oil and salt on the nose. The palate combines concentrated, lush raspberry with bay leaf, lots of turned earth and chaparral seasonings.<br />points: 92","price:   18<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This young wine remains tight and tannic, with light cherry fruit highlighted with fresh orange. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of earthiness.<br />points: 86","price:   23<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The winery's value bottling, this was vinified principally in stainless steel, with 25% in neutral oak. It's a chunky, earthy style, letting a bit of tart cherry fruit peek through. Tannins are drying, with a textural finish tasting lightly of concrete.<br />points: 86","price:   28<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the first release of the new vintage from Soléna. Primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry seem a bit disjointed, and there is a hole in the midpalate. A suggestion of rubber tire sets in as the wine finishes. More bottle age is in order.<br />points: 86","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Scents and flavors of beet root, rhubarb and cranberry are front and center in this stiff, tart wine with root and acidic flavors. It spent 22 months in one-third new French oak, but that doesn't register on the palate.<br />points: 86","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Not a mere whole-cluster wine, the Stalker is made by drying the stalks separately and adding them to whole berries. It's slightly chalky as a result, with a green edge to the tannins and green tea flavors. Black cherry, espresso and cacao components also factor in. Give it another couple of years and drink after 2020.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Crunchy red fruit is front and center in this vineyard-designate, well capturing the tone of the appellation.

There's a touch of black licorice and impressive balance throughout.<br />points: 90","price:   23<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Smoky, with traces of cherry and vanilla, this is a heavily tannic version of the variety, seemingly aged in full-strength oak. Aromas are elusive and the finish brief.<br />points: 83","price:   20<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Funky earth and a diluted body make for a generic experience with this wine, which simultaneously offers a large tannin profile plus a weedy, dried herb component.<br />points: 83","price:  134<br />points: 98<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness.<br />points: 98","price:  319<br />points: 98<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors.

It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.<br />points: 98","price:   95<br />points: 97<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness.<br />points: 97","price:  125<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.<br />points: 96","price:   90<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity.<br />points: 95","price:   24<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins.<br />points: 82","price:   15<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Vibrant aromas of spice, cranberry and plum lead into a vivid, juicy, youthful wine with plenty of tangy fruit. The acids are way out in front, but the fruit has a zip to it, and there is little or no suggestion of new wood to get in the way.<br />points: 87","price:   25<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Given its modest price and weighty alcohol, this wine should find many admirers. Thick and tannic, it could pass for a heavier red than Pinot Noir, and it offers bulky, rustic fruit flavors, with some heat on the finish.<br />points: 86","price:   24<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Quite light in both aroma and flavor, this hits the palate softly, with tart, thin fruit and a jarring, somewhat plastic note that persists into the finish. There's a hint of chocolate, but not much going on here.<br />points: 84","price:   54<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is Londer Vineyard fruit though the vineyard is no longer a designation of its own. Still, like vintages past, Fulcrum has worked its magic with the long-coveted spot, crafting an herbal, savory Pinot that's mouth-filling in blueberry fruit. Voluptuously soft, this is a great wine for the table, perhaps paired with a pork roast dripping in mushrooms.<br />points: 92","price:   75<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  There's a slightly sour smell to this offering from Coomber Family, who produce “wines for animal lovers.” However, the sipping experience is pleasant enough, with hard cherry candy, a range of spices and a lingering licorice finish.<br />points: 84","price:   27<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rustic, hearty aromas of tar, cola, herbs and burnt rhubarb make for an intriguing nose on this entry-level bottling from Testarossa.

Tightly wound black raspberry and strawberry fruit notes meet cinnamon, camphor and dewy eucalyptus on the nose, while the palate packs an array of thyme and bay leaf against a lighter cranberry fruit base.<br />points: 90","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A trove of wild strawberry wraps around a concentration of full-bodied smoothness in this deep and brooding wine marked by a juicy core and plenty of length on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   30<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and edgy at first, but these characters should mellow with another few months in the bottle. It's boldly flavored, with black cherry and beet notes upfront, while subtle mocha and vanilla shadings emerge on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fragrant and soft, this sends up a chocolaty mix of strawberry and raspberry fruit scents and flavors. It's a barrel selection from a variety of vineyards, and is young enough to show a stiff, somewhat herbal edge to the tannins. Give it an hour or two in a decanter for best drinking.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Citrus and chocolate come up from the glass, wrapped together like chocolate-covered orange peel. The core fruit is tangy raspberry, spicy and focused. This drinks like a young wine in terms of both vineyard and bottle age. It should continue to improve with a bit of cellar time.<br />points: 89","price:   28<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a pretty wine, forward and fruit-driven, with orange-juice highlights around cherry fruit.

It's light and bright on the palate, with plum-skin-driven tannic tartness, but there's not much else going on.<br />points: 86","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Cinnamon-cola characterizes this soft, rounded expression of subtle dark cherry and herb. It comes from a sloped vineyard in the middle of the Russian River Valley near Olivet Lane, where moderate temperatures are impacted by morning fog. Layers of toasty oak grace the finish.<br />points: 86","price:   30<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  The color of this wine has a touch of brown at the rim. The aromas are almost overripe, with a syrupy, balsamic note on the palate. Overall, the wine is full bodied, quite tannic, and finishes with a sun-dried plum flavor.<br />points: 85","price:   32<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  All five vineyards contribute to this widely available blend. It's on the chunky side, with blocky black cherry and a frame of milk chocolate from aging 10 months in French oak. There's a dash of spice as it races through the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The aromatics shine here, sending up a happy mix of ripe cherries and baking spices. The fruit carries the midpalate, with medium density and appealing, though blocky, flavors. This is not a complex wine, but most enjoyable.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from the 80-acre estate vineyard, this would seem to qualify as the winery's reserve-level bottling. Light scents of musky umami suggest the estate's unique terroir, and those mushroom flavors, along with cola and red berry, continue throughout. The finish is tart and tight.

A solid Pinot for a sunny day.<br />points: 88","price:   20<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This vintage-dated Pinot Noir is the newest addition to the Evolution lineup. Tart and tangy, its light and lively pomegranate and raspberry flavors come from grapes principally fermented in stainless steel. In your wine-drinking pantheon, it might find a comfortable place alongside a cru Beaujolais.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Faint cranberry and incense aromas show on the nose of this bottling.

Likewise, in terms of texture, it's sturdy enough to last a few years, but not so tough as to be off-putting. Complex, flavorful and supple, it should be at its best through at least 2016.<br />points: 90","price:   12<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A strong, vibrant texture of crisp acidity and firm tannins energizes this flavorful and distinctive wine.

It's long and concentrated, with good aging potential.<br />points: 93","price:   30<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This blend of grapes from Bien Nacido, Presqu'ile and Riverbench vineyards is light in color with aromas of turned earth, dust and sliced strawberries. It's elegant and lean on the palate, with lots of slate and graphite minerality warming up toward macerated strawberry sauce. Pair with everything from white fish to pork tenderloin.<br />points: 92","price:   24<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  There are judicious hints of turned forest floor and barnyard funk on the nose of this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills, with a licorice and wild berry fruit backbone. A lemon brightness highlights the palate, along with tobacco, black olives and a pronounced bitterness. The strong acidity will drive an evolution, so drink 2018–2030.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Canary Hill Shines in this new vintage, with mixed and juicy fruit flavors of cranberry, raspberry and cherry. It has good grip and a well-balanced herbal note, finishing with hints of green tea.<br />points: 92","price:   15<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  One generally approaches a $15 Oregon Pinot Noir with extreme caution, but here is a lovely surprise. Clean, soft, balanced and reasonably varietal, this is as good a value as you will find in this price-driven state. The flavors are soft and supple, with butter and caramel streaks strongly evident. Don't look for big fruit, but what is there is crisp and clean.<br />points: 85","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Rhubarb, cranberry and strawberry mix on the nose in this richly inviting wine that is textured and not overwhelming in weight. Featuring electric acidity, the wine finishes boldly in blackberry and licorice.<br />points: 90","price:   42<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A softly unfussy wine with moderate acidity, this is rounded and light-bodied, with rose petal and red cherry aromas. The oak is subtle and supportive.<br />points: 88","price:   42<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Rose aromas emerge on the nose of this block-designated, light-bodied wine. It's full of crisp red fruit and bright acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Fresh raspberries, red cherries and even blackberries arise on the juicy nose of this wine from Adam Lee, but it's lifted by wild mint, hummingbird sage and damp coyote scrub. The palate is very herbally spiced, with thyme, marjoram, black cardamom and charred pine, laid across dried strawberries, cranberries and sour cherries, all tied together by serious grip. Drink 2019–2025.<br />points: 93","price:   85<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Ribbon Ridge AVA is home to a small, select group of near-cult wineries, and fruit such as this is the reason why. Compact and refined, it delivers beautiful aromas of raspberries, with a subtle dustiness that might be Oregon's answer to Napa's famed Rutherford dust. Terrific concentration and pinpoint definition make this a wine to savor immediately, or cellar for enjoyment through 2025 and beyond.<br />points: 93","price:   48<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A beautiful trio of fruit flavors—red cherry, rhubarb and raspberry—provides harmony in this vivid and pure-tasting wine. The freshness and clarity of the fruit elements is well backed by lively acidity and moderate tannins to keep it clean and appetizing from first sip to last.<br />points: 93","price:   58<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This pulls off the neat trick of being both light and dense, with fruit running the gamut from strawberry to cherry to cassis. Deeply concentrated, and with lovely purity and length, this is delicious now but will surely drink even better in a few years. Drink 2018 through 2028.<br />points: 93","price:   55<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  All types of tea, from black to nettle to Greek mountain to chamomile, show on this wine's herbally powered nose, with bits of sagebrush and wild berries thrown in for good measure. Tea elements also power the palate, along with cranberry fruit and raspberry leaf, held together with grippy tannins, at least for this grape<br />points: 93","price:   24<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Made in a careful, non-intrusive, natural style, this combines wild strawberry and peppery herb flavors. It offers moderate tannins and a strongly herbal finish.<br />points: 89","price:   38<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This drinks a bit lighter than previous vintages, with light strawberry and thin, tart cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent and slightly green. It's worth cellaring until 2019 to let additional bottle age smooth out the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   16<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  The cherry and cinnamon aromas are true and inviting, and they stand up to the oak that's been thrown at this Pinot. The flavor profile deals raspberry and cherry amid oaky shadings. The finish is toasty and warm, with some coffee popping up late in the game. Fresh, fruity and true.<br />points: 85","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Freshly squeezed red currants, rose petals, sweet sagebrush and potpourri-like perfume arise on the nose of this bottling. Those florals extend to the palate, where it meshes with rhubarb and pressed-strawberry flavors.<br />points: 87","price:   40<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  With scents and flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, this pretty and accessible Pinot Noir promises a bit more than it delivers. The light cherry fruit turns a bit earthy and tannic as it winds into a quick finish.<br />points: 86","price:   22<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a light, simple wine, mixing tart cranberry fruit with streaks of leaf and stem. The rather low alcohol and overall lightness makes it a good summer quaffing red.<br />points: 85","price:   22<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This has a strong impression of sweetness, to the point of being almost cloying. That candied raspberry flavor is offset with citrusy acids, giving it a sweet/tart candy character. The flavors don't quite sync up.<br />points: 85","price:   22<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is labeled reserve, but has the same early release and light fruit flavors as the less-expensive regular bottling. Cranberry and celery-stalk flavors are the main elements, and the finish turns quite chalky.<br />points: 85","price:   11<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Woodsy, savory, plummy aromas and rather light cherry and black-tea flavors give this wine complexity. It's medium bodied, easy to drink and enjoy, especially at such a reasonable price.<br />points: 87","price:   68<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A darkly tannic wine, showing a dry side of Pinot Noir but still offering some good berry fruits and raspberry sweetness. The acidity needs to soften, though.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Refined and subtle, this shows the power of Pinot at its most elegant. The fruits are mellow, melded and lightly marked with baking spices. Smooth and showing surprising density, it has the frame and finesse to age beautifully. Drink now through 2025.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The star of the single-clone lineup, this feels like a truly complete wine, with pinpoint focus. Complex fruit flavors mix berries and cherries with a touch of spice. Lively and detailed, this perfectly balanced wine does not push too hard, and delivers intriguing aromatics threaded with baking spices and a lingering finish. Drink 2020 through 2030.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a subtle, svelte and elegant wine, floral in rose petals and violet, the crisp, bright red fruit leaning more toward cranberry and pomegranate than juicy strawberry. With the oak and acidity well-integrated, it provides a seamless, delicious experience, touched by a taste of black tea on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Planted on a relatively cool site for the Russian River, the Laguna Ridge, this Pinot is velvety and lush in baked strawberry and black raspberry, a celebration of finely grown, ripe fruit, with sharp-edged acidity and waves of savory mocha. With pronounced oak that mellows in the glass, it should only become more interesting with a few more years in the cellar, through 2022.<br />points: 92","price:   39<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Part of the winery's Terroir Series, this is aromatic with bright raspberry fruit dotted with peppery herbs. It displays the spicy herbaceousness of this AVA, with excellent penetration and balance. A strong finish hits a resonant note of minerality.<br />points: 92","price:   34<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Like its companion, Carpe Noctum, the Confero offers full flavors of cherry and berry, with spice and toast backing. Here the flavors are a touch lighter but perhaps more elegant and detailed, with suggestions of mint and caramel trickling through the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   45<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected. Here, rich fruit flavors highlighted with streaks of caramel and toffee get things rolling quickly. Berries and cherries, firm acids, pretty spice and a lingering butterscotch finish.<br />points: 91","price:   17<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  After initial horsy aromas of saddle, earth and roasted berry settle, there's oak and a chemical note to the palate, which also delivers herbal, tart flavors of raspberry and green plum. This is lean and citrusy on the finish.<br />points: 84","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With big holdings in the appellation, the Château de Santenay produces a range of wines. This single-vineyard bottling is typically rich and rounded. It cushions the tannins with ripe fruit and gentle acidity. Developing well, the wine will be ready to drink from 2017.<br />points: 88","price:   19<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Quite possibly this has the largest production of any single Oregon Pinot Noir, which makes the quality even more impressive. A bit in the vein of a Beaujolais, this offers Gamay-like flavors of red berry and wild cherry. It's broadly fruity and forward on the palate, with zippy acidity that punches through the finish.<br />points: 88","price:   80<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Much lighter than the winery's other bottling of this level, this wine shows cranberry, light olive and the slightest hint of eucalyptus on the nose. Cranberry, black pepper, pencil lead and earth show on the palate, which makes for a very nice wine, just not quite as stunning as the Bien Nacido version.<br />points: 89","price:   20<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Pink-orange in color, this is a tangy, high-acid wine that's not for everyone, given its bracing mix of tangerine and grapefruit. Light-bodied, yet textured, it's a good quaffer and food-friendly companion.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.<br />points: 88","price:   29<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A 100% varietal wine fermented in stainless steel, this is a bright, lively tangle of cherry and orange built around bristling acidity that practically sizzles on the palate. Light-bodied and plenty crisp, it mellows to show length and breadth on the finish.<br />points: 88","price:   16<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Light colored wine with a touch of smokiness and soft, ripe fruits. It lacks definition, giving an open feeling without much structure. Wood aging gives a burnt character at the end.<br />points: 84","price:   35<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This opens with classic Oregon Pinot scents of rose petal and cherry candy. In the mouth the toasty barrel flavors wrap around the juicy fruits —raspberry, cherry and more—with streaks of butterscotch creeping into the succulent finish. It's pure pleasure.<br />points: 92","price:   15<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Dusty cherry and tomato aromas are neither elegant nor elevated. A jagged palate lacks flow, while this tastes of salty sour plum. A low-depth finish tastes peppery. Overall, this is simply adequate Pinot Noir.<br />points: 83","price:   17<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Perhaps the palest Central Coast rosé of the year, this Pinot Noir-based wine almost looks like water, but the aromas of marcona almond and delicate lemonade assure that it's perfect for a picnic on a hot day. The strong acidity tantalizes the mouth, and would make excellent pairing for shellfish or simply cooked white fish.<br />points: 88","price:   80<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A brooding texture and fully layered concentration of intense flavor spark the palate and mind in this estate wine, which is showy in cola, bark, black cherry and black tea. Medium bodied and well-made, it finds balance between its coastal influence, its crisp acidity and the burlier aspects of fruit and weight.<br />points: 93","price:   72<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Showing just a touch of reduction, this wine is bright, crunchy and explosive on the palate. The palate shows a mix of raspberry, cherry and cranberry that's full of flavor. Seductively smooth, it should continue to evolve and expand with time, as the wine is just beginning to unravel its complex notes of baking spice, vanilla and tea.<br />points: 93","price:   68<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Plum and cherry fruit notes combine here, feeling concentrated through the midpalate. Although aged in one quarter new oak, the barrel character has little impact on the flavor. It remains a bit tight and should continue to improve with bottle age. Drink 2019–2031.<br />points: 93","price:   28<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Like the winery's other Pinot Noir, this seems way underpriced for the quality. Its subtle layers of cherry and plum are enhanced with baking spice, toasted coconut and caramel highlights. It can easily stand beside wines costing twice as much. Drink now through 2028.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Winemaker James MacPhail continues to refine his solo project with this Annapolis-sourced effort, a smooth layered expression of baked strawberry and rose petal herbaceousness. Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time.<br />points: 93","price:   85<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish.<br />points: 93","price:   30<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  The producer sources from multiple sites across the appellation, including its own estate, in this value-driven red. Minty bay leaf provides an undeniable sense of earthiness, as medium weight and acidity pierce through. It's silky in spice.<br />points: 88","price:   15<br />points: 81<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Smoke and leather tack-room scents and flavors, making for a sharp, short, fruitless wine.<br />points: 81","price:   25<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C.

Time in the cellar may allow it to meld, but for now it's meant for lovers of smoke and oak.<br />points: 85","price:   26<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C. Iijima <br> description:  Yeasty bread notes mingle with preserved cherry and raspberry tones on this dry, but fruity, Pinot Noir sparkling. It's quite bold on the palate with big, mouthfilling foam, and finishes with a touch of mushroom.<br />points: 85","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This feels a bit sharp in the mouth, the oak (25% new) punching through some fairly light fruit. Wild-berry flavors come up against chewy tannins. The wine has some power, but lacks a little bit of balance at the moment.<br />points: 89","price:   26<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This is a solid wine from a new appellation, offering much promise for vintages to come. Baked red cherry, smashed pomegranate, cinnamon and bay leaf play on the nose, while anise, light clove, strawberry, red plum and red apple vie for attention on the palate.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tart black-cherry fruit carries a load of earth and stem flavors, along with notes of bitter chocolate shavings and espresso grounds. It's tannic and tart, with a dash of sassafras threaded through the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   48<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This Pinot is a full, fragrant, fetching wine with spongy citrus and cherry fruit, underscored with leesy minerality.

Pencil shavings add to the complexity.<br />points: 88","price:   28<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This shows light, tangy cranberry and raspberry flavors on the fresh, straightforward attack. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much detail, finishing with a touch of acidity.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Light in color and in the fruit flavors that are front and center, this tastes of straightforward cranberry and raspberry. It's pleasant but on the simple side, and its tannins bring a touch of green flavors as it wraps up with a gentle suggestion of milk chocolate.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This complex and positively charged wine has light savory aromas, and nicely earthy and spicy flavors that evolve into focused fruitiness with each subsequent sip. It ends up tangy on the finish due to crisp acidity and firm tannins.<br />points: 92","price:   96<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount. Built to age, it wraps earthy dried herbs around cherry, strawberry and boysenberry, with a juicy core of acidity. A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish.

It smells like black cherries and light baking spices, tastes like rhubarb and raspberry but also has some clove and cedar notes that add complexity. It's an all-around palate-pleaser that seems to keep improving hours after opening.<br />points: 92","price:   52<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rich earthy tones of iron and sagebrush meet with a touch of barnyard, roasted meats, dark cranberry fruit and a touch of sarsaparilla on the nose of this Josh Jensen bottling. More iron, wet clay, turned loam and slate minerality show on the palate, where black pepper, cooked black cherries, pomegranate and cranberry round out the still quite tannic sip.<br />points: 92","price:   30<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine seems soapy and out of focus. It's soft while missing fruit. The acidity and freshness at the end are the best parts.<br />points: 83","price:   65<br />points: 97<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  From first sniff this exquisite wine grabs you and won't let go. Brambly berries, redolent with rich umami notes of spice and pine needle cascade into a wine densely packed with fruit and herbs.

Iijima <br> description:  Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure.<br />points: 90","price:   85<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  An estate-grown wine in its second vintage, this comes from the cooler-climate hills of the coast.

At 14+% it's ripe enough to build a core of sweet cherry fruit; but it is not shy about expressing the herbal side of the grape, and does so to good effect.

It has a range of sweet fruit flavors, allied to dark tannins, suggesting aging potential.<br />points: 93","price:   95<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Classic Pommard, a big, firm, tannic wine that is foursquare and dominating. It broods with its dense structure and concentration. The fruits are solid, with plum skins, red berries and bursts of acidity. All this adds up to a wine that needs to age. Aim for five years before drinking.<br />points: 93","price:   90<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is rich, sweet, extravagant and, finally, elegant. Its ripe fruit flavors, red plums, sweet strawberries and smoky acidity all work together. The wine shows considerable concentration, but never loses sight of freshness. Age for another five years at least.<br />points: 93","price:  225<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Initially round, this develops a strong minerality, with a texture that is firm and dominating ripe fruit. There is definite austerity here. The wine is at present firm and tough, and needs several years to open up.<br />points: 93","price:   70<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A structured, relatively cool Volnay, dominated more by ripe tannins than by fruit. The fruit that is there is fresh, layered with acidity, juicy in texture, with cranberry and black plum skin flavors. The finish suggests red berries with its firmness. The wine demands at least five years' aging.<br />points: 93","price:   75<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A beautifully perfumed wine, all herbs and smokiness. The palate sings the same tune, a rich, sensuous one, laced with more somber notes of dark, dry tannins. At the end of the day, this is already a delicious wine, but one that will really improve over 5–10 years.<br />points: 93","price:  115<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Corton is the largest grand cru in Burgundy (all of 240 acres) and its style can vary widely. Bouchard has gone for a relatively soft style, emphasizing fruits, raspberry, myrtle and black currants, topped with acidity. It is a light, delicious wine, but probably not for aging.<br />points: 93","price:  125<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A dense, almost heavy wine, with smoky, licorice flavors that dominate the fruit. It is firm, big, solid, the sort of wine that demands attention with its concentration and powered structure. It may need time for aging, but already the power and weight are there.<br />points: 93","price:   85<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well.<br />points: 93","price:   28<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Relatively light in the glass, this blend of nine vineyards from up and down the coast shows savory baked plum, cardamom dust, earthy cranberry, bay leaf and smoked meat on the nose. It's medium bodied on the palate and very down-the-middle flavor-wise, with cranberry, oregano and thyme elements.<br />points: 89","price:   48<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Fresh and packed with red fruits, this wine comes from the Faiveley domaine.

Drink from 2018.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  La Casita is all clone 114 and 50% whole-cluster fermented. In a year with many wines showing minimal ripeness, this breaks the mold. The forward strawberry fruit hints at sugary sweetness. Flavors are fresh and appealing, front-loaded and best for near-term consumption.<br />points: 89","price:   68<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Even in a fruity year, Pommard lives up to its reputation for firm tannins. This wine will have delicious ripe black fruits, although not just yet. The structure and the dark tannins are up front, leaving tantalizing hints of the richness to come. Drink from 2019.<br />points: 89","price:   80<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  From vines in the north of the Nuits Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée, this is a structured wine.

It spent 18 months in one-third new French oak. Despite the reserve tag and the excellent vintage, it comes across as simple and a bit dilute.<br />points: 86","price:   28<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is an earthy, minty, tart and taut wine, worthy of its appellation.

The acidity is moderate and as of yet not fully integrated.<br />points: 86","price:   23<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Just barely out of barrel when released, this will surely benefit from another year or so in bottle.

It will do well in such settings, but is also a worthy addition to the table, balanced and structured to pair memorably with a wide range of foods.<br />points: 91","price:   20<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a memorably refreshing and reasonably complex effort, a crisp, delicious mix of tangerine, grapefruit and fresh strawberry made by the saignée method.

Lively and aromatic, it carries a streak of beetroot threaded through blackberry fruit. It's tight and tense, like a coiled spring, suggesting that some additional bottle age will help to open it up. The concentration is impressive, and the flavors continue on through a lengthy finish, with a suggestion of gunmetal as it subsides.<br />points: 91","price:  105<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Using grapes sourced from estate vines planted in 1972, this wine is comparable, in its subtlety and delicate elegance, to an old-vine Zinfandel. Strawberry and spice run through the core, with brambly highlights and excellent balance.

The grapes are sourced from a block in the estate vineyard at the highest point of the hill, and the wine is aged in 30% new French oak for 14 months. Tasted a few weeks prior to its official release, it was stubbornly unyielding, even after a full 24 hours. Given the pedigree of this estate, and the superb quality of the two other 2010 Pinots, it is reasonable to expect this to come out of its hard shell and earn a much higher score.<br />points: 92","price:   32<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Even at $32, this remains one of Oregon's best-value Pinot Noirs.

It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach.<br />points: 87","price:   47<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.<br />points: 87","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This wine shows a touch of spicy, smoky oak from aging in 20% new French barrels, setting off powerful fruity, earthy flavors that create a complex, layered and fascinating personality. It's full bodied, mouth-filling and moderately tannic.<br />points: 92","price:   59<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From a Green Valley vineyard high on a ridge, this is an exceptional and softly layered wine, with cola, plum and black cherry notes. Offering length and breadth with moderate acidity and oak, it's dark and brooding in all the best ways.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Quite light in color, this wine has a ton to like, starting with its thyme, oregano, juniper and tart cranberry aromas. The palate is overloaded with energy, showing snappy raspberry, kalamata olive and iron-rich mineral notes. A great example of fresh Pinot Noir.<br />points: 92","price:   52<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This is a very supple wine from a vineyard just north of Highway 246, with baked strawberry, iron, cinnamon and allspice aromas, recalling French toast on the nose. The palate is tarter, with cranberry, rose petal, fennel frond and vanilla flavors that carry deep into the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   58<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rich red cherry, rust, smoke and crushed gravel aromas show on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Smoked meat, lavender and rose petal notes play with cranberry, pomegranate and hibiscus flavors, creating a pleasant mix of delicate and savory elements.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Juicy, penetrating raspberry fruit launches this tight young wine into the center of the palate. The overall balance and prominent acidity suggests that it is a good cellar candidate. Drink 2020 to 2030, and aerate aggressively if you plan to pop it in the near term.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  My favorite of the 2005 releases from Gypsy Dancer, this is a complex wine that seems to be holding back, like a fine race horse at the starting gate. It's got the concentrated core of cherry fruit, which leads into mixed berries, toast, spice and more. A light earthy streak supports notes of root and soil, and the midpalate is a bit subdued, but the flavors come roaring back at the end, gaining strength and suggesting that this is a wine to cellar for some years.<br />points: 91","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The barrel aging is still the defining element in this wine, adding layers of meaty fat to what appears to be very young fruit. Bright cranberry and cherry notes are set in firm acids. Well-integrated hints of herb and spice, bursts of sweet berry and dry, tea-flavored tannins sail through the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The juice is sharp and spicy, with some baking spice and cinnamon livening up the back of the palate. The fruit flavors suggest boysenberry and blackberry, set up against stiff acids and earthy tannins. Young and still a little rough around the edges, this distinctive bottling should be cellared for a few years and could go as long as a decade or more.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A blend of seven different vineyards, the name is French for spoon. This is a softer, less tannic wine than most of the other Torii Mor 2005s, but is not quite what you would call silky. Mixed red fruits, light scents suggesting flower as well as berry, and a feminine elegance characterize this Pinot. It's been carefully crafted to emphasize the subtle herbs and spices, without hiding behind the more obvious flavors of new oak.<br />points: 90","price:   75<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Soft and rich, with appealing flavors of chocolate, cherry and butterscotch, this is a seductive wine. It is ripe but not hot, and the chocolaty richness wraps around the sweet cherry fruit but retains just enough of the leafy quality that defines it as Oregon. Nice balance and structure too.<br />points: 90","price:   28<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The winery's Willamette Valley cuvée is right on target in 2012, loaded with luscious cranberry/raspberry fruit.

Raspberry and cherry fruit is dappled with dried herbs, black olive and hints of dark chocolate.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From an estate vineyard planted high atop the Sebastopol Hills near Freestone, this wine impresses from start to finish. It shows unique white pepper and floral aromas, while a seamless texture supports its succulent cranberry and cherry flavors, a long, lingering accent of nutmeg spice rounding out the finish.<br />points: 95","price:   50<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases. Raspberry, rose petal, cola and cinnamon stick show on the nose, while the palate offers rounded flavors of dried strawberry, thyme and game. It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.<br />points: 95","price:   72<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.<br />points: 95","price:   45<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.<br />points: 95","price:   75<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.<br />points: 95","price:   44<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The nose of this bottling explodes with exotic cherry scents and compelling strokes of iron, rose, carnation and cinnamon. It's refreshingly tart and earthy on the palate, where dewy sage, mint and tarragon touches lift its youthful raspberry and green olive flavors. Easy to guzzle, yet intriguingly complex.<br />points: 95","price:   65<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best.<br />points: 95","price:   75<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This head-turning wine was made from vines planted in the 1970s and 1990s—a selection that shocks with its complex beauty. Pine forest and Christmas spice notes accent cranberry, rhubarb and tart citrus flavors, all seemingly infused with seductive smoke.

It is textured, with some firm tannins as well as ripe plum flavors and acidity. The wine is still developing and will be better from 2016.<br />points: 89","price:   36<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The toasty framework around soft and spicy red fruits needs a bit more bottle age to integrate fully. Accents of herb and leaf add a bit of complexity which show promise for future enjoyment. Drink 2018–2022.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This makes a nice change from the simply fruity norm. The color is a traditional light garnet with a bronze rim, while the aromas resemble rhubarb and raspberries. Flavors are earthy, savory and meaty rather than straightforward grapy. The texture is rather soft, the tannins muted and the body not too full.<br />points: 87","price:   35<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is chewy and tannic, with sharp edges around cranberry fruit. It's blocky and one-dimensional, but solid and substantial. If Pinot Noir can ever be a steak wine, this is it. A touch of anise and coffee winds it down through the finish.<br />points: 87","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Saint Clair's Pioneer Block wines are always worth trying for their expressions of Marlborough's subregional characters. This one, from deep clay soils at the foot of the Dry Hills, features a bold cherry aroma and flavor, backed by ample vanilla and baking spice notes. It's big and slightly chunky in style, but it seems likely to smooth out over the next 12 months as the dusty tannins subside.<br />points: 91","price:   66<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rich and full, this wine shows some sense of structure. It has considerable acidity and flavors of cherry and red currant. With the dry tannins coming through on the finish, it will need some years to soften.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  This is an amply endowed, round wine, with no hard edges. The ripe cherry fruit is dusted with hints of dusty earth and ground cinnamon that linger on the finish. It's a lush, harmonious mouthful of Pinot pleasure. Drink now–2020.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  One of the top offerings from Saint Clair is invariably its Omaka Reserve. The 2010 features blackberry and cola notes that are accented by a hickory smoke tone, a harmonious and supple texture and a moderately long finish. Ready to drink now, the wine should easily last another few years.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Bright and high in acidity, this has a lively cherry flavor, plus a layering of earthy mushroom.

Oaky and soft, it possesses a funk of earthiness.<br />points: 87","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This new vineyard site, on the east side of the Chehalem mountains, has delivered a precisely rendered, spicy wine, with a pleasing mix of leaf, herb, berry and earth flavors. It's cut on the tart, acidic side, but it's neither dull nor simple. Given its balance and texture, it may well age for another decade or more.<br />points: 90","price:   19<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  This smells reedy and like beets blended with mint and other green herbs. The palate has a shrill feel, while the flavors trend toward herbal red plum, salt and oak. A green-leaning finish is choppy and high in acid.<br />points: 84","price:   12<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Chemical smelling oak, sawdust, plastic and milk chocolate aromas create a less-than-stellar nose. This is oaky/lactic feeling, with snappy acidity cutting through the palate. Flavors of generic red fruits and wood finish without much follow through<br />points: 84","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  A deep sniff delivers leather, ripe black cherry, marzipan and some smokiness, but the palate isn't congruent. It's candied, a bit burnt, and it tastes just a tad too much like cherry cough syrup. The texture is fine and the flavors solid, but it falls short in the areas of layering and elegance. It's too one-dimensional and not multifaceted. –M.S.<br />points: 86","price:   65<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Young and tightly wound, this wine from the family's Olivet Lane Vineyard is reduced and generous in oak and spicy dark cherry, its aromas resplendent in rose petal. Layered and soft, it's big on complexity and plush textures, with a lengthy, caramel-and cola-laced finish.<br />points: 88","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A feral, somewhat sauvage aroma of pungent earth opens this wine, followed by notes of bay leaf and mint. Spicy and vibrant in red fruit, it is buoyed and balanced by acidity that keeps this full-bodied wine from ever seeming weighed down.

Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) is the owner/winemaker, and his skills producing full-bodied robust reds are put to good use here.

It's not a big wine, but it is balanced, and was barrel-aged for 18 months in a percentage of French oak. It should drink well now through 2022.<br />points: 89","price:   24<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This debut effort from a small, family-owned winery offers light, pretty scents of Dr. Pepper, red berries, rose petals and vanilla.

There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.<br />points: 91","price:   24<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a delight—a supple, polished, ripe and full-throttle Pinot Noir offered at a mid-1990s price. Winemaker Aron Hess keeps the alcohol at 13.5%, the oak a moderate 20% new, and the earthy underpinnings gracefully in check. Lush purple and blue fruits are lightly licked with chocolate; the result is a very satisfying mouthful of wine.<br />points: 91","price:   23<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut.

In 2012 it ripened to considerably higher Brix than the previous year, yielding a full 2% higher alcohol. Still the impression is of wood, earth, stem and hard red fruits that need further softening. The finish turns a bit chalky.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Two bottles were tasted; the first showing some signs of incomplete fermentation. The wine is lean, grapy and tart—stylistically apart from the other 2012 releases. Though relatively high in alcohol, the flavors don't seem to have the full physiological ripeness you might expect.

The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also.<br />points: 92","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Edgy and herbal, the 2010 Reserve mixes cranberry fruit with Mediterranean herbs.

Drink from 2020.<br />points: 92","price:  100<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a real cherry bomb, showing terrific concentration and purity of fruit. Those vibrant flavors come in a swath of cola, then dive into a compact finish that leaves a residual hint of chocolate seltzer. This wine seems to be slightly bottle shocked (though it was rested for some weeks after being shipped) and may well deserve a higher score with more bottle age.<br />points: 92","price:   85<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  At first this seems sculpted in a feminine style, meaning elegant, graceful and light on its feet. It's a complete and satisfying wine, with strawberry, raspberry and cola flavors intertwined. Some tougher tannins show up in the finish, suggesting that a few more years of bottle age may add both length and further complexity.<br />points: 92","price:   68<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Violet, lavender, mulberry, black cherry, cola, graphite and a touch of sarsaparilla lead the nose on this bottling from this vineyard planted in 1997.

Weight and richness combine with a solid core of tannins. The intense, refreshing acidity is a counterpoint to the ripe black-plum flavor. With all of this concentration, this should age for over 5–6 years.<br />points: 91","price:   72<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The tannins are already finely integrated into the rich, ripe fruit.

Aromas of pomegranate juice, sour plum and elderberry jam meet with juniper, wet tobacco and spearmint on the nose. The palate packs black plum and blackberries with rose hips, black tea and more tobacco.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This three-vineyard blend is still quite tight and tannic.

Drying tannins wrap it up.<br />points: 88","price:   60<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Dry and spare, this offers stem and herb flavors ahead of a tight core of raspberry fruit. A Pommard and Dijon 114 clone mix, it spent 19 months in 27% new French oak. It seems to need another year or two of bottle age to come together.<br />points: 88","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This bold, round and supple wine manages to remain bright and light, offering supple streaks of cranberry and cherry that take on some of the appellation's inviting cola spice. Brick tar in color, it gets better in the glass and offers good value.<br />points: 88","price:   30<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's a simplicity to this medium-bodied wine, which is high in acidity and basic in its fruit.

This Pinot has a cushioned feel with moderate but present acidity.

Wood aging provides a judicious support to its fullness and opulence. Acidity, black cherries and red berry fruits come together with firm tannins.

Tart and tangy, its light and lively pomegranate and raspberry flavors come from grapes principally fermented in stainless steel. In your wine-drinking pantheon, it might find a comfortable place alongside a cru Beaujolais.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard.

Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Presumably unfiltered, this wine is slightly cloudy, which leads to a nicely creamy mouthfeel.

Special indeed is this fruit, a three-clone estate vineyard selection. Blackberry and black cherry dappled with cinnamon is at the heart of it, supported with balanced natural acidity.

This is one of the better ones, at a very modest price, mixing sweet grass and fresh pear and stone fruits. It would be difficult to identify it as Pinot Noir in a blind tasting of mixed whites, but that's not the point, is it?<br />points: 90","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A lightly spicy wine, this mixes rather thin red-currant and raspberry flavors.

It could age for another year.<br />points: 85","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish.<br />points: 89","price:   28<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  It's pronounced tung-GEE and was formerly known as Chehalem Mountain vineyards. As is often the case with this AVA, it has substantial tannins and a firm, compact structure that bodes well for cellaring. The fruit mixes cherry, pomegranate and hints of banana, while the barrel flavors add some toast and butter.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though relatively young (planted in 2001) this Dundee Hills vineyard can deliver the goods. This is full, juicy, packed with ripe fruits, moderately deep in color, and limned with sharp, herbal, astringent tannins. It could profit from a bit more bottle age, to take the edge off the green tea in the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here is a powerful young wine with concentrated plum and cherry fruit.

The pleasant fruit is somewhat offset with chalky acids and drying tannins.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine is a blend of De Ponte, Schindler and Kalita fruit, smooth and supple, though falling a bit flat in terms of mouthfeel.

The palate gets more expansive, offering cranberry as well as a hint of softer fruit like strawberry, with some crushed rock as well. This is a very affordable expression of Pinot Noir in what was a tough vintage, showing that the new energy BV is placing on this series of wines may just pay off.<br />points: 87","price:   60<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine offers concentration in spades, a toasty rich bevy of heavy, black fruit flavors that sit with purpose on the tongue. From a Green Valley-area vineyard the grapes hung long until profound ripeness, resulting in this big boy wine.<br />points: 87","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  There's been a huge jump in production of this wine since the past vintage, which may signal some surge of interest in white Pinot, which has lately become a bit of a trend in Oregon. The wine is simple, neutral and perfectly quaffable, but carries no hint of varietal character.<br />points: 87","price:   22<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Scents of smoke and ash dominate and obscure the fruit when first you open the bottle. Swirl it around and the light cherry and cranberry fruit emerges, along with a lick of milk chocolate. But the scent and flavor of smoke lingers, presumably from barrel aging, and ultimately your opinion of the wine may hinge on your personal preferences in that regard.<br />points: 86","price:   60<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This bottling is still a bit disjointed, the acids stick out and the fruit seems confined to a tight corner. The raw materials are good enough—berries and watermelon, a whiff of tomato, moderate tannins and more than a hint of new oak. Give this one another year or two to smooth out the wrinkles.<br />points: 86","price:   61<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Straightforward Pinot Noir scents of red fruit, deep raspberry, fennel and menthol make for an uncomplicated but alluring nose on this wine from an historic vineyard.

But it smells attractive and pleasant, with cedar and briar. In the mouth, it runs along a tart, lean line, again a reflection on the year.

The wine's spice and wood flavors are still evident, although these will get well integrated into the rich red-fruit flavor.

The black-cherry fruit is framed with a bit more barrel toast than the other Brick House Pinots, having been aged for 18 months in 40% new wood.

Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel.

From a meticulously farmed vineyard also known for Chardonnay, it conveys a stamp of tobacco on the oak that invites thoughts of leather chairs and cigars.<br />points: 90","price:   49<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Lightly colored and tightly wound, this wine offers a bouquet of rose petals around a core of cherry and cranberry with buoyant acidity.

These older vines deliver that extra dollop of texture and mouthfeel that elevates the drinking experience. Powerful and yet elegant, it brings a panoply of berries, baking spices, Asian spices, nougat, caramel and milk chocolate. It delivers all of this and more, without feeling heavy or overblown.

If it follows the path of other Ayoub Pinots, this will benefit greatly from further bottle age.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This complex wine shows a whiff of stem, from 37% whole-cluster fermentation, and quickly moves into a soft center, loaded with strawberry preserves. It coats the mouth, smooth and textural, with graphite highlights. The tannins are substantial and suggest it's worth tucking into the cellar for a few more years.

This is a fine everyday mealtime option with versatility to spare.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fruity and forward, this is a pretty, approachable wine with bright berry and cherry fruit. There's a strong note of citrus, particularly orange flesh and rind, and it's the sort of no-nonsense, gluggable wine that one rarely finds associated with Pinot Noir. This will be best enjoyed by 2018.<br />points: 88","price:   65<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Cherry compote and a flair of kirsch preside over well-tended acidity in this full-bodied wine.

Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.<br />points: 88","price:   28<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Production is up six-fold from 2013 levels. Spicy cherry/berry fruit is set against tongue-tickling acids.

With soft strawberry flavors that have melded into the rounded texture, this is a wine that has only the lightest tannins. Acidity and an attractive ripe fruit character make this a wine to enjoy now.<br />points: 89","price:   48<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Smoked raspberry, mulberry, rust, slate and a bright hibiscus touch show on the nose of this appellation blend, which tends to be more widely available than the winery's single-vineyard expressions. Cranberry fruit meets with rocky minerality on the palate, as wild herbs add to the complexity.<br />points: 89","price:   35<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Herbal and peppery, with a brambly character to the cranberry/raspberry fruit, this seems to be hiding the influence of aging in 25% new French oak. Extra time in the bottle could bump up the score.<br />points: 87","price:   10<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This medium-bodied red wine doesn't quite track the classic Pinot Noir profile, but will make an appetizing refreshment for lunch or dinner.

The grapes come from recently-planted vines in the estate vineyard.<br />points: 87","price:   70<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve-level bottling, and gets the most new oak, about 60%. In this vintage, the fruit seems a bit thin, almost watery, although with some hours of breathing it gains some palate traction. It's well made, but don't look for reserve-level heft.<br />points: 87","price:   15<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine bursts with the scents and flavors of fresh strawberries.

It's quite quaffable and simultaneously thought-provoking, with concrete minerality and razor-sharp acidity framing Pink Lady apple and blood orange fruits, with a subtle ashy component as well.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Cherry, licorice, stemmy spice, turned earth and Earl Grey tea elements show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard west of the Sta.

It's a delicate, nicely crafted wine that could be cellared through 2025.<br />points: 90","price:   35<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This unfiltered, reserve-level wine ripened nicely in 2013, yielding a silky, high-toned palate with plum, berry and cherry fruits. Still in its infancy, this demands decanting and/or additional bottle age. It's a lovely evocation of both finesse and power, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   15<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C.

Baking spices and a hint of cocoa penetrate through the hard shell of acid and tannin. Needs more time.<br />points: 86","price:   38<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Easier to find than Jeriko's Pommard or Dijon bottlings, the Reserve is dark and earthy with mushroom, dark cherry and a tiny bit of spice floating behind the scenes. The 14.7% alcohol level brings this wine into a bigger style of Pinot territory but is welldone and should get even better with time.<br />points: 88","price:   29<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C.

Too much alcohol adds heat to the mouthfeel, and a vinegary nose distracts from the good fruit.<br />points: 85","price:   22<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Starts off with strong aromas of wintergreen and cola, then settles down to display plenty of  roasted cherries and cedar-sarsaparilla notes.

Fleshy aromas of chunky, brambly fruit also offer a lot of pepper, both black and green. With good body and texture, you’re hopeful for more in the mouth, but the fruit is marred by the essence of veggies, even tasting a bit stewed.<br />points: 82","price:   39<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Delightfully piercing and pungent, the brambly bouquet features a little oak-driven caramel to soften up the leather and smoke elements. The mouthfeel is big and cushy, and at first there’s lots of vanillin on the red-fruit palate. With breathing, it really opens up and comes together, showing complexity and style galore.

It's got substantial palate weight and a fairly thick mouthfeel.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is clearly aimed at consumers who seek maximum power, aggressive tannins and the dark end of the flavor spectrum. Though down a bit from the 15.5% alcohol in 2012, it's still substantial. Dry roasted dark fruits are covered in brawnier flavors of coffee grounds, chocolate and graphite.

Only 48 cases produced.<br />points: 87","price:  105<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rich, packed with  juicy fruit. The wine has weight, depth of fruit flavor and tannins as a central core. A smoky character indicates the wood aging, packing in with the acidity and black cherry fruits on the finish.

Deliciously juicy and textured on the palate, it finishes with a touch of tobacco and black tea.<br />points: 93","price:   55<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A rugged and feral quality marks the nose of this excellent wine. Black raspberry and plum aromas are laid across savory beef fat, dried sage and scents of mint, pencil lead and Indian spice. The mouthfeel is soft and the palate is meaty, with baked plum, black cherry, black cardamom and raw beef flavors, lifted by a minty quality.<br />points: 93","price:  140<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is dense and still firm, although the red-berry fruits are being to integrate well into the structure. It shows signs of its wood aging that will need to go away for the wine really to develop. However, a juicy background promises well. Drink this wine, from a small Grand Cru close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, from 2020.<br />points: 93","price:   20<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Rather simple and plain, this Cellar Select trips across the palate like a ghost. Not much there in the way of fruit or flavor.<br />points: 82","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This wine comes from hillside vineyards in the far northern reaches of California's grape growing counties. It has an unusually dark color for Pinot. The ripe and fruity aromas are accented by oaky spices and flavors that bring out black-cherry and clove notes. It's full bodied, mouth-filling and flavorful.<br />points: 90","price:   65<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine takes a light approach to ripeness and oak, letting the freshness of the fruit speak with abandon. Bristling in acidity, it offers a layering of complementary dark cherry, huckleberry, pomegranate and cola, before a thick concentration of power peaks on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Still knitting itself together, this entry-level cuvée from Bergström brings fresh raspberry fruit flavors front and center. There are toasty highlights as well, nicely framing the finish, promising further development in bottle after 2018.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This barrel selection has a bit more volume and depth than its sibling, Lylee. Its tart raspberry fruit leads into drying tannins that are dappled with dried Italian herb notes.<br />points: 90","price:   46<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine's strawberry and raspberry flavors carry a slightly funky bouquet, but call it a feature, not a flaw. It has salted caramel notes from aging for nine months in 30% new French oak, and it's creamy and focused on the palate, finishing on a hint of cola.<br />points: 90","price:   39<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Pungent earth is met by dark handfuls of baking spice, dried cherry and chocolate in this rich, velvety and full-bodied wine that's smooth and rounded on the palate.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits. It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021.<br />points: 88","price:   24<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This aromatic wine is delicious Pinot Noir. With fine ripe red fruits that are shot through with tannins for aging and crisp acidity for refreshing drinking, this is a rich wine that should be drunk now.<br />points: 88","price:   65<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This very limited block selection is too thin, herbal and green to offer much pleasure. Tannins are stemmy and overtake the fruit.<br />points: 85","price:   24<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This Pinot falls on the lean side of the fence, with firm acid and tannins and mature flavors reminiscent of old-style European wines. It has a slightly tawny color at the edge, a brick color in the middle, earthy-oaky aromas, and lean cranberry and cedar flavors.<br />points: 85","price:   48<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Despite the famed vineyard on the label, this seems a bit gauzy, chalky and stripped. There are light suggestions of berry and cherry, and hints of the nice details of earth and mineral that old vines can often bring. The finish is dilute and slightly metallic.<br />points: 86","price:   78<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Succulent and complex, this wine offers substantial body and lush plushness on the palate, alluring in its layering of cardamom spice and orange, cranberry and cherry. Satisfyingly ripe, with inimitable balance, it shows the elegance possible in spite of the appellation's power.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This zesty and fresh bottling offers thyme, bay leaf, cooked cranberries and piles of dried chapparal on the garrigue-focused nose.

The baked strawberry carries into the palate, lifted by hibiscus, lavender, white sage and potpourri flavors.<br />points: 94","price:   52<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A nicely snappy raspberry impression characterizes the nose of this energetic wine. Fresh herbs and aromatic woods are prominent as well, from marjoram to pepper, fennel to sandalwood. The palate's zesty acidity shows tangy, underripe raspberry and cranberry fruit, lots of chaparral and sagebrush spice, and even some minty eucalyptus. It's vibrant and delicious.<br />points: 94","price:   65<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Adam Lee's bottling from one of the region's most famous vineyards is a winner for fans of the rich style of Pinot, lush with blackberry jam, lilac, cinnamon and gingerbread. The palate is similarly dense, soft and sultry, with tart olallieberry jam and plum jelly, but also lively with thyme, spearmint and a unique lemon verbena kick.<br />points: 94","price:   59<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Riddle is in Green Valley, on a high ridge prone to morning fog. This resulting effort showcases a sizzling, mouthwatering basket of wild strawberry, cherry and vanilla tea, managing to be plush, lush and elegant simultaneously. Juicy and pleasurable, it's immediately enjoyable, silky and the right kind of rich.<br />points: 94","price:   36<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This is a great wine at a price that's a bit more accessible than many similar bottlings from the region. Pepper, berries, rose buds, mace and clove combine for a suave, savory but smooth nose. It's immediately likable on the palate, where thyme, bay leaf and sage give nuance to cooked strawberries and tangy plums.<br />points: 94","price:   68<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A brilliant example of how this grape can be done with deft decadence, this bottling reveals aromas of black cherry, crushed clove, nutmeg, smashed slate and tons of forest-floor components, including juniper. Black plum, mace and dark cinnamon converge on the deliciously rich palate that is bolstered by bursting acidity and big structure. But this wine may be too massive for aging, so drink up.<br />points: 94","price:   86<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From some of the property's oldest vines, this wine conveys a nostalgic component that's hard to resist, an approachability that meets length and breadth. Baked bread, cherry, vanilla and black tea give way to zesty acidity and a note of forest floor, but nothing competes with the allure of rose petals and orange blossoms that beckon around every corner.<br />points: 94","price:   58<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Adam Lee makes some concentrated wines each vintage, and this one shows cherry syrup, sandalwood and some smoke on the dense, layered nose.

It nearly bursts with ripe and vivid fruit in the aromas and the flavors, bringing red and black cherry, hints of mint and fresh raspberry kicking in on the finish. Despite all that generous fruit flavor, it also maintains a taut balance via moderate tannins and firm acidity. It will be best after 2020.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This brilliant wine is supremely focused from the aroma to the finish, like a laser beam of rich and concentrated Bing-cherry flavor. The purity of the fruit makes it delicious to taste, and to feel the burst of cherry spread from the bright aromas on to the palate and to linger on the finish. Drink after 2019 when it should broaden a bit.<br />points: 94","price:   20<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Light in intensity and weight, with herb-inflected cranberry and cherry aromas and flavors that veer toward strawberry on the finish.<br />points: 84","price:   12<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Solid Pinot Noir at this price isn't something you find every day. Plum, cherry and earthy spice notes are varietally on target. This feels round, but with adequate acidity and good balance. Light oak flavors accent cherry and red-plum notes, while this tastes slightly green on the finish.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rock—not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well.

It's a muscular blend of scents and flavors of lavender, cherry and chocolate wrapped into a firm, focused finish.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry.<br />points: 87","price:   36<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Black tea, charred cherries and tree bark aromas arise off this wine from a cooler part of a warm appellation. The wine is a bit thin and light on the palate once sipped, with pomegranate fruit. Drink at the beach or with lighter fare.<br />points: 87","price:   39<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light in color, this is a smoky, thick and oaky red wine that evolves to reveal a delicate texture as it nears its finish. The fruit is densely packed and jammy, as well as nicely layered.<br />points: 88","price:   44<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Drawn from the company's holdings in the Awatere Valley, this is a medium-bodied, supple Pinot Noir. A sturdy frame of cedar and mocha surrounds mouthwatering cherry fruit. Drink now–2018.<br />points: 89","price:   36<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak.<br />points: 85","price:   35<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pungent with strong aromas of stem and herb, the fruit suggests green banana and other minimally-ripe flavors.

It's a lovely mix of blueberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, lively and bright, with polished acidity and 30% new oak just peeking through. Drink it young with a nice chunk of wild salmon, or age it a few years and bring on the lamb chops. Either way, you're in for a treat.<br />points: 91","price:   22<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is an outstanding value in a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir—soft, subtle and spicy, with sweet strawberry and cherry fruit. All neutral oak fermented, the mouthfeel is smooth and supple, and the flavors have a sexy, delicious quality that says “drink me now!”<br />points: 91","price:   65<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Earthy aromas of rust, loam and dark red plum meet with scents of charred oak on the nose of this bottling. There is a bright acidity to the sip, but it surrounds a darker core of cran-raspberry fruit, with peppery spice and well-integrated rosewater flavors showing toward the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   80<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Planted in 1974, principally with Pinot Gris, this limited selection mixes high-acid citrus and pineapple flavors with a touch of leather and wild mountain-berry fruit. It's complex and hints at great detail, but remains stubbornly tight even after several hours. As with many Eyrie wines, the ageability is unquestioned, and this should continue to improve for many years to come.<br />points: 91","price:   23<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A vertical red stripe reads “Twentieth Anniversary” along the left side of the front label. One suspects that such a milestone receives special care, and this certainly shows it. Aromatic with scents of cherries and blossoms, this is supported on a firm, almost steely frame of acid and tannin, and dotted with hints of herb and seed and grain. It's not a big wine, but given its chance, should age gracefully for up to a decade.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Funky in spearmint and a carbonic notion of freshness, this wine offers cranberry and barely ripe strawberry, adding to its sense of delicacy. Mild shakes of white pepper play on the palate, as the finish finds a bolder weight of tannin.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The reserve bottling shows more phenolic bite than the easy-drinking regular release. There are tight deep streaks of stem and earth, along with scents of cola and sassafras, and stiff tannins framing tight cherry fruit. This is the one to tuck away for a couple more years while drinking the regular Willamette Valley bottling.<br />points: 91","price:   38<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Tart and herbal in sage, this is a densely concentrated wine that wraps its head around black cherry, cranberry, pomegranate and black tea.

Lively flavors consume the palate quickly with tart cherry and peppery spice, all lifted by mouthwatering acidity.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The somewhat restrained nose of this bottling is powered by chaparral and herbs, with sagebrush, juniper and thyme decorating the tight cranberry fruit. The shrubby element sticks to the palate as well, with more garrigue spice seasoning the cranberry and raspberry base.<br />points: 91","price:   34<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A sweaty smell opens the wine, followed with light strawberry and leafy herb notes. In the mouth the wine is thin and tart, with a hard, tannic finish. There isn't any stuffing, and it lacks the elegance and precision that could take the place of mere power. What's left is leafy, herbal and astringent, but charmless. Two bottles tasted.<br />points: 83","price:   25<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Susan Kostrzewa <br> description:  Black pepper and bright cherry on the nose lead into flavors of red berry, cherry and smoke.

Young and tart, it needs more time to flesh out and show more detail. Currently the baking spice accents from aging in one-third new oak, appealing as they are, stick out a bit. Give this until 2016 or so to bottle age.<br />points: 90","price:   49<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced entirely from the Rose Rock Vineyard in Oregon's Eola-Amity Hills, this is fresh and carries plenty of strawberry fruit alongside cola and a whiff of smoke.

The tannins are light, perfectly ripe, and nicely balanced against the juicy fruit flavors.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A single-clone, single-block cuvée, this is nonetheless complete and satisfying. Blackberry and black cherry fruit are dusted with cinnamon and allspice. A vein of cola and a whiff of sandalwood add further complexity. More elegant than powerful, this retains its balance through a medium-long finish.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Medium weight and nicely focused, this brings spicy fruit flavors of cranberry and cherry into play. There's ample tart acidity, and aging 16 months in 42% new French oak has not turned it into a walk through a lumber yard.<br />points: 89","price:   20<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is full bodied while retaining varietal specificity. Tart strawberry, cherry and plum fruit anchors a strong midpalate, with proportionate tannins bringing a touch of black olive to wrap it up.<br />points: 89","price:   39<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  All the right components are in place here, but not yet entirely melded into a complete whole.

The Aegerter's version is relatively light, as much fruit as tannins even while it is young. Berry fruits comes forward, while the layer of tannin is in a supporting role.

Bright red-cherry fruit and hibiscus shows on the sip, yet it's a tad dried out. Slate and riverstone touches add minerality, and the structure is defined by a rocky grip.<br />points: 88","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The 2011 Resonance Reserve has just a bit more concentration than the elegant regular bottling.

Gingerbread, red cinnamon and Christmas spice liven up the baked red-plum fruit of the palate, laced with rich oak flavorings. It's not a dainty wine, but it's certainly delicious.<br />points: 92","price:   20<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This needs some breathing time to soften its rough edges. Herbal notes compete with black raspberry fruit. Some spicy highlights lead into a tannic finish.

The grapes are picked at low yields and fermented with native yeast.

Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time.<br />points: 93","price:   62<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Lush and concentrated in texture, this vineyard-designate is bright and tart with a bite of crunchy tannin and a bouquet of rose and lavender lurking on the nose.

Fermented by native yeast and using some whole clusters for the astringency and flavor that stems can add, it has a texture that's moderately tannic and nicely supported by acidity.<br />points: 93","price:   20<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a nice, lower-priced option of the variety, spicy in raspberry and strawberry, with a medium-built weight.

In this price range, from this excellent vintage, you might expect more ripeness and concentration.

Here are very strong, dominating flavors of vanilla and breakfast tea, of the sort often associated with oak additions during the winemaking process.

This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in—although not enough to spoil the fruitiness.

In other words, this tastes not at all like regular, red Pinot Noir.

Drink from 2019.<br />points: 89","price:  110<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  From vines situated just under the line of great Grand Cru vineyards, this is a structured wine. It is surprisingly under-powered for the appellation, although its balance is just right. So firm black-plum skins balance a combination of tannins and black-cherry fruits that are topped with acidity.

Red cherry flavors are already as important as the acidity and the dry core. That means this is not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2017.

On the palate, the wine offers classic varietal flavors of berry and tart plum, along with nuanced highlights of sassafras, bramble and a slight hint of hemp.

Right now, it’s firmly acidic, but there’s enough rich black-cherry fruit to suggest it will be more approachable in a couple of years. Shows nice varietal features: a velvety (but not heavy) mouthfeel and black and orange tea notes on the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   25<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Someone explain this labeling: La Creole Vineyard is a blend of 96% Feltz Vineyard and 4% Madrona Vineyard? No matter the name, it smells good, boasting plenty of smoky and woodsy aromas. The flavors are immature, almost grapey still, with some unintegrated vanilla and toast from oak, and fine tannins on the finish. Needs some time; give it a couple of years’ rest before popping your first cork.<br />points: 89","price:   34<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  There’s a persistent menthol note running through this wine that may prove controversial. My money is that it will integrate with time (say, 2–3 years) into the otherwise rich cherry fruit. The finish is explosively fruity and long, which bodes well for the future.<br />points: 89","price:   52<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This charming wine isn't big or rich, but it has an appetizing tang, supportive texture and attractively restrained flavors. There's a tawny rim to its medium garnet color, loads of fruit and spice to the aroma, and cherry, tart cranberry and oolong tea flavors. Well-balanced, it will drink best after 2019.<br />points: 93","price:  100<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This blend of four parcels from different premier crus is structured with all the density of this fine village.

Its raspberry fruit is accented and lifted by bay leaf, thyme and white pepper notes, with a saline hint of kalamata olive. That boundless energy continues on the palate, where crisp pomegranate blends with marjoram.<br />points: 93","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Planted in 1993, this four-acre, cool-climate vineyard had a relatively late harvest in 2005, which can, in the Pacific Northwest, result in more European, vertically structured wines. This is wrapped up tight, and is far away from the sweet, succulent fruit of California Pinot Noir, but its pleasures are many and varied. Clear and bright, its berry-cherry fruit is shaded with leaf and earth. The tannins are firm but quite polished, and the flavors meld together seamlessly.<br />points: 91","price:   20<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  For a modestly priced Oregon Pinot, this is a punchy, pleasing wine, centered on brambly purple berry fruit flavors, framed in toasty, spicy tannins.

Rich and full bodied, it is a testament to the intrigue of baking spices and black tea, but more significantly to dark chocolate and espresso.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Aged in French oak for 16 months, this soft and supple Pinot is ready for immediate enjoyment. The fruit leans toward raspberry and Bing cherry, with subtle streaks of tea, chocolate and a finishing kick of heat.

The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice.<br />points: 92","price:  100<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From a barrel selection of the Quintus block, planted to the 828 clone of Pinot Noir, this wine offers a bigger mouthfeel and heartier vinous experience, awash in darker cherry fruit and more substantial tannin. Floral in rose and violet on the nose, those floral highlights return on the palate, giving the wine a nice tension and balance.<br />points: 92","price:   75<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Intense and feral in brooding dark cherry, this Terra Neuma from the extreme Sonoma Coast vineyard known as De Coelo is owned and tended to by the Benziger family, who pull out all the stops with its annual collection of Pinots from the site. Earthy, this one is also silky, subdued and quite elegant.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Fantastically bright acidity defines this wine, the winery's “finest selection,” which is memorable for its crisp black cherry and strawberry core of fruit. Voluptuous and silky on the palate, it carries a hint of Asian spice throughout, the slightest taste of wild vanilla wrapping things up on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing.<br />points: 92","price:  150<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Archery Summit's top cuvée is young and brash, a jangle of brambly berries, threads of incense and chocolate, assertive acids and not quite integrated tannins. It will require some patience, either in the cellar, or in the decanter (hours!) but has an underlying plush texture and an exotic mix of spices that elevate the pretty fruit to the next level.<br />points: 93","price:   90<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Immaculate flavors of raspberries and Bing cherries are set in a well-structured frame of barrel toast and tannin. There is ample, yet unintrusive acidity, and the balance throughout is perfectly maintained. Drink now and over the next five or six years.<br />points: 92","price:   24<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A splendid example of affordable Oregon Pinot, this benefits from a great vintage for forward, fruit-driven wines. It has additional assets: balance, texture and length, all compact in a young wine still in its infancy. The sappy raspberry fruit and overall polish suggest giving it another couple of years of bottle age before opening.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here is a compelling mix of berry, cherry and citrus fruits that are forward and punchy, with a touch of clay anchoring the finish. It was aged for 18+ months in a mix of new and neutral French oak.<br />points: 91","price:   30<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This dark, full-bodied and well-balanced effort is jam-packed with flavor. A big burst of blackberry, blue plum and black cherry holds down the center palate. It's focused, fresh, ripe and lingers broadly. It's a wine to buy by the case and drink over the next decade.<br />points: 91","price:   36<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a finesse wine, with light flavors of pomegranate and cranberry. There's a suggestion of burnt toast—just a hint—around the tannins, which remain a bit stiff and chewy. Give this another year or two and it should open up further.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This has a big burst of spicy, toasty oak right up front. That's often a sign of a young wine, and this is one with the fruit and depth to handle the extra toast. Cola, black cherry and a touch of clean earth come through, with a suggestion of tanned leather. It's got inviting complexity, coupled with forward, fruity flavor. Drink 2018–2026.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is juicy, almost jammy, with forward flavors of strawberry candy that fill the mouth and hang tight.

It's full, forward and fruit-powered.<br />points: 91","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Still light and astringent, this seems to be in some bottle shock: the score is a guesstimate. It's been well-rested, and tasted over a 24-hour period, but more aging is recommended. Stem and leaf flavors accompany tart raspberry fruit. The rating could rise or fall depending upon how it cellars.<br />points: 91","price:   18<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Quite hard and almost impenetrable at first, this slowly opens to give a glimpse of compact, dried blueberry fruit and a dash of dark chocolate. The tannins are hard and herbal also. Aeration will help.<br />points: 86","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Jenkins is a Charlie Chenoweth-farmed site, an 18-acre vineyard in the Sebastopol Hills.

It's entirely exotic and delicious, both concentrated and lush.<br />points: 94","price:   32<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Yet another example of where a producer's slightly cheaper appellation blends are just as stunning as the single-vineyard expressions. Steve Dooley's bottling offers black sage, dried tarragon, fennel, beet juice, cranberry, Earl Grey tea and smoked game on the nose. The palate shows smoked pork with a black-cherry rub, a touch of pencil lead and an intriguing red-sumac flavor.<br />points: 94","price:   38<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Though not one of the producer's single-vineyard bottlings, this estate blend manages to stun the nose and palate nonetheless. Tart mulberry, Kalamata olive, hibiscus, rose hips, red plum and sandalwood aromas wrestle attention immediately, then the sip delivers bergamot, cedar ash, exotic cranberry and rosemary depth. It delivers an excellent combination of wood, fruit and herb.<br />points: 94","price:   50<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This revamped label by Josh Klapper of La Fenetre is exciting on all fronts, and this four-barrel bottling from Aubaine Vineyard is one of the best. Light red cherry and pomegranate meet with gravel, dried basil and oregano on the delicate nose. Thyme, bergamot and Earl Grey tea flavors pop on the tight palate, which is still wound up but offers underripe strawberry, fennel and lavender florality.<br />points: 94","price:  460<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is dark and structured, offering ripe fruits although they are covered at this stage by the tannins.

This ripe, rich and concentrated wine is full of jammy strawberry fruits that are deepened by the wood aging. The structure and the density of this wine show that it will age well. Drink from 2023.<br />points: 94","price:  140<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  First recorded in 1375, this vineyard produces powerful, concentrated wines. This fine example is dense, weighty and firm. The acidity is there, buried in the firm tannins. It is a wine with an enormous potential, dark and full of plum skin and berries.

It has a good future, so don't drink before 2023.<br />points: 94","price:   32<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Strong, dusty, stringy herbal notes run right through this wine, contributing to an overall impression of thin not-ripe-enough-for-prime-time fruit. Tart and hard, it's principally cranberries and bitter herbs, with a tannic finish. It helps to give it a lengthy decanting and/or aeration.<br />points: 86","price:   65<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  With a handsome percentage of whole-cluster fermentation in the mix, this wine shows a funky undercurrent of marshmallow and mushroom.

Floral highlights lead into tart cherry fruit that seems to gather strength as it flows across the palate. There are hints of mineral and a splash of coffee in the lingering finish.<br />points: 92","price:   16<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This medium-bodied wine has low-key fruit and herb flavors, and a reasonably smooth texture. A touch of earthiness runs from aroma to finish.<br />points: 85","price:   32<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The back label notes that this is the winery's reserve, sourced from Methven Family vineyards. The flavors seem to avoid ripe fruit in favor of stem, leaf and citrus. There's a bit of rhubarb, but nothing more substantial, and it quickly turns thin and tannic.<br />points: 85","price:   48<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Sheldon's Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir is exquisite. Very light in color (and alcohol level at 12.9 percent), it opens with gorgeous raspberry and violet aromas.

It's surprisingly short and light given its pedigree. Tasted three times with same results.<br />points: 88","price:   30<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine has intense acidity along with red fruits, showing the freshness of the year.

The wine could be better from 2016.<br />points: 84","price:   62<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From an estate vineyard, this wine is somewhat unformed and quite feral, largely tannic, with a rough-hewn texture. The oak is overwhelming and needs time to settle, to better reveal the abundance of strawberry and cherry fruit.<br />points: 84","price:   16<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine has layers of the acidity typical of the vintage. For fruit it is juicy with tight red-currant flavors and more of that intense acidity.

Maybe it's the vintage, but the wine seems dilute. The flavors of tart wild berry, earth and herb have a thin, edgy character; and the tannins seem greener than what would be optimal.<br />points: 86","price:   63<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Edwards has worked with this Laguna Ridge site for decades and her intimate understanding of it shows. Rose petals ride a voluptuous texture and concentrated notes of chocolate, caramel and black cherry; it's as savory as it is buoyant and floral. Still holding on to a wealth of tannin and body, it will cellar well despite being delicious and enjoyable today.<br />points: 95","price:   85<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From four acres at the crest of a knoll onsite, this wine is indelibly crisp in cranberry and orange.

The nose on this bottling is delicate but with tons of sexy, supple depth, mixing red cherry, hibiscus and pomegranate with iron and sweet bay leaf. Perfect red fruits decorate the lavish palate: the tartness of cranberry, the lushness of red cherry, the brightness of pomegranate, all cut by eucalyptus and expert acidity.<br />points: 94","price:   60<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From the producer's Sebastopol Hills hillside vineyard, this is a perfumy, elegant wine, a combination of lavender and roses with sizable tannins and a backbone of acidity. Dark black fruit and game swirl together with a complex addition of dried herb and violet. This is a lovely wine now, but will benefit from further cellaring through 2023.<br />points: 94","price:   85<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A warmth of baking spices like cardamom and nutmeg charge an otherwise earthy, herbal wine.

Plenty of toast and Bourbon-barrel scents lift the open, with a hint of sharpness from the alcohol.

Delicious already, it has the structure to age for a decade or longer.<br />points: 93","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Momtazi vineyard supplies these grapes. The wine has a sharp edge to it, a sense of raw wood that pushes against tart, stiff red fruits. Whiffs of smoke and salted chocolate add welcome nuances. The winery's AVA series provides interesting, nicely differentiated wines at somewhat moderate (for Oregon Pinot) prices.<br />points: 89","price:   35<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from some of the oldest and best blocks, dating back to 1983, this brings whiffs of saddle leather across supple, savory fruit.

This 2008 from an above-average vintage is certainly showing signs of rich maturity. It has developed the undergrowth aromas and spice flavors of ready-to-drink Pinot Noir.

Sweet fruit—berries, currants and jam—is perfectly matched to more subtle scents of sassafras and tobacco.

Soft and velvety on the palate, it veers into tangy, oaky and spicy finishing touches.<br />points: 92","price:   39<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  One of the producer's lighter-styled wines, delicately delicious, this shows forest floor, orange and lemon in a brightly crisp, high-toned package of polish and grace. A touch of rhubarb--strawberry compote lurks on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   24<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The 2006 is a richer vintage than this winery's 2005, showing more heat, more density and more of the milk chocolate in the finish. What it gains in weight it loses in elegance; it's a stand-off really. Winemaker Scott Shull does his usual careful job with the fruit, getting the most from the particulars of the vintage.<br />points: 88","price:   38<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Temperance Hill manager Dai Crisp and his crew make the wine they want to drink themselves.

Tart and juicy black cherries are at the core, with a burst of citrus in the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   44<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Most Vista Hills Pinots see only neutral oak, as is the case here. The emphasis is on high acid and clean red-fruit flavors. It's simple and fresh, but it seems as if a touch of new oak wouldn't hurt a bit.<br />points: 87","price:   36<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This new entry into the burgeoning ranks of white Pinot Noir is a real acid bomb. Apart from the searingly tart lemon flavors, only a slight hint of roundness in the finish differentiates this from an especially tart Sauvignon Blanc.<br />points: 87","price:   40<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here is an unabashedly earthy, old-school Oregon style. The fruit suggests wild raspberries, with a dash of cola. The flavors are a bit dilute, and that earthy character dominates.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A whiff of smoky campfire opens this wine, followed by an unlikely counterpoint of lavender. Notes of black cherry and strawberry then unfurl, along with plenty of earthy mushroom and forest floor. The wine reveals a tension of weight and body as it evolves in the glass, with a bite of tannin on the finish. Let it open a bit.<br />points: 91","price:   45<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Subtle, spicy oak influences mingle beautifully with tasty Bing cherry and persimmon flavors in this medium to full bodied wine that has a silky texture, crisp balance and fine-grained tannins. Good balance and interesting complexity propel it more than fruit intensity.<br />points: 91","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's an intensely rustic earthiness to this wine, complemented by white pepper and nutmeg. Medium bodied, it also offers sizzling acidity and tart red cherry. Lithe, it builds toward a robust, ripe end.

The fruit flavors are muted at first but develop nicely with each sip.<br />points: 91","price:   75<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Damp earth, forest floor and huckleberry pie combine for a complex take on the variety, building texture and body on the palate as it goes. Relatively full bodied, it comes off as lighter and smoother than perhaps it is, revealing denser, more structured heft on the finish.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a restrained and structured wine, light in tart cranberry, rhubarb and an overwhelming attraction of baked plum.

It's 100% Pommard from 20-year-old vines, but in this chancy vintage the fruit flavors did not get quite fully ripe.<br />points: 87","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This is a very friendly wine that is medium bodied, has a brownish tint to the color, slightly earthy aromas, warm fruit flavors like cooked cherries and a touch of brown sugar, plus a mellow lightly tannic texture.<br />points: 87","price:   39<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though single vineyard wines can be impressive, there are times when they'd be better as components in a blend. This is the case here. Just on the edge of sour, the very tart grapey flavors seem overtaken by acidity, without compensating depth or complexity.<br />points: 87","price:   48<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This opens with strong scents and flavors of stem and herb, and shows some potent tannins as well.

Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are set against stiff, drying acids, and seem a bit blocky. Think of it as a chunky style of Pinot Noir, and pair it with a fat-inflected filet of wild caught salmon.<br />points: 89","price:   64<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This wine hits the mark for spicy aromas, rich flavors and a velvety yet vibrant texture.

Brownish in color, it conveys strong earth, spice and new-leather notes in the aroma, followed by flavors like black tea, rhubarb and cedar. While it was aged for an unusually long time in 70% new French oak, it comes off as layered and spicy but not at all overoaked.<br />points: 91","price:   18<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C.

It has full-bodied flavors of cherry and sassafras, accented with cinnamon and cocoa. The barrel spices outlast the fruit—perhaps just an indication of youth. There is potential for considerable improvement with bottle age.<br />points: 88","price:   65<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Just two barrels were made of this wine, a new release based upon a vineyard selection and a decision to use no new oak. Admirable in concept, but not quite there in execution, this wine is soft and earthy, with plum and a whiff of cocoa. The midpalate seems to have a slight dip in it, not a hole, but not a smooth ride either.<br />points: 87","price:   28<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a delicious expression of the genre, medium bodied and forcefully crisp, with delicate lacings of cherry, apricot and peach.

The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward.

The palate is redolent with dried thyme, oregano, marjoram and fennel that meet with cooked cranberry fruit and turned-earth flavors.<br />points: 92","price:   48<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Goldridge honors the soil series so important in the appellation, offering floral aromas that lead into silky-smooth texture with tension. Earthy, it conjures notions of fresh-picked strawberry, black tea and kirsch, with an approachability that doesn't distract from its complexity.<br />points: 92","price:   85<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  An estate-grown vineyard-designate, this impressive offering is smooth in cherry, berry and clove, with wisps of black pepper dancing around its edges. The finish is long and spicy. It's complex yet fun, and will do well at the table though it's also easy enough to enjoy on its own.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Dark fruits carry a streak of gunmetal down the spine of this wine, which remains solidly anchored in its most youthful phase. Blueberry and raspberry flavors come with a crisp tart acid edge, and develop with lip-smacking precision as the wine lingers through a lengthy finish. Drink now and over the next 12–15 years, through 2030.<br />points: 92","price:   48<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine astounds in big, juicy waves of jammy cherry, strawberry and forest floor, its fruit sourced from Gap's Crown, Dutton Ranch, Goldrock Ridge and Jenkins vineyards, among other sites. Textured and layered, with powerful force, it shows richness and concentration but also fresh acidity.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The dense nose of this bottling intrigues as it unleashes dense blackberries, graphite, slate and a touch of licorice. The palate is tightly wound, with pomegranate, elderberry and tart plum enhanced by fennel, bay leaf and an aromatic lift on the finish. Bottle age will improve this wine immensely.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Earthy baked cherry and a strong streak of cardamom make for an impressive entry to this wine, flavors that persist on the palate. Beautifully rich without being ridiculous, it finds balance in complex, layered textures and nuanced characteristics, with a length of rose petals on the finish.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Rick Longoria is all about restraint in his winemaking, and that shows on the shy aromas of this bottling that allow hints of black plum, wildfire, roasted meat and light rosemary to emerge. Tart plum and cranberry fruit pop on the palate, where a feral, gamy component is laced by forest floor and wild herbs.<br />points: 92","price:   35<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This small producer has adopted WWI motifs for its labels; the wines are less striking. Here, a soft entry followed by a thick streak of vanilla. Oak treatment buries the fruit, making it drink like a cheaper, more generic wine than it purports to be.<br />points: 85","price:   35<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Sweet-leaning aromas of black cherry, cola and anise show on the nose of this appellation blend. The flavors are much more subtle, with touches of cherry, cranberry and gravel.<br />points: 85","price:   65<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is aged four years prior to release, which proves a benefit here, as it helps tame the spicy wild-berry flavors. The aromatics offer an olfactory tapestry of orange peel, violets, sandalwood, cherry cola and more. It's balanced and sophisticated, offering many subtle pleasures.<br />points: 89","price:   25<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  It's rare to find estate-grown, Willamette Valley Pinot, from a vineyard in high demand, made by a top-tier winemaker, at this price. Still young, tight and tart, this is a very pretty wine, with tangy cherry fruit, a touch of rhubarb pie, and plenty of acidity. Another year or two of bottle age would be optimal.<br />points: 89","price:   79<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine has density and a good structure. It also has the acidity that marks the vintage. Red-cherry fruits and a crisp texture are balanced by the firmer tannins and solid character at the end. Drink from 2020.<br />points: 92","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.<br />points: 92","price:   51<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is structured and concentrated with solid tannins. It has great ripe red fruits and plenty of berry flavors. It is going to be a fine wine, full of both fruit and structure as it develops. Drink from 2022.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The juiciness of this wine, made by a producer based in Savigny, is what makes it so good. It is so fruity, with the tannins really only in a supporting role. That means it will develop quickly with the typical Savigny generosity. There is an attractive sprinkling of spice at the end. Drink from 2020.<br />points: 92","price:  120<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With ripe fruits and solid tannins, this is going to be a rich wine.

Drink from 2023.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine comes from a single vineyard in the large 90-acre Château de Chamirey estate. It is beautifully balanced, rich and generous. Great red-plum fruits are there along with acidity and finely textured tannins. This is going to be a warm wine with a fine future. Drink from 2022.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  There's a strong menthol, juniper and pine needle kick to the nose of this bottling, alongside intriguing green tea and tart plum-skin aromas. Eucalyptus oil leads the lively herbal kick of the palate, giving intense depth to the hearty black-plum and tobacco flavors, all framed by a fresh acidity.<br />points: 92","price:   68<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Light and fresh aromas of red cherry, dark strawberry and sagebrush make for a fairly easy but rather deep nose on this single-vineyard bottling. Rich cranberry and pomegranate flavors coat the palate, with compelling edges of fennel, root beer and light clove.<br />points: 92","price:  123<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This finely made wine has weight and firm tannins, along with intense acidity. Faiveley owns 12 acres of this premier cru which produces structured wines with fruit tannins and smoky fruit. At the end, the wood aging gives a burnt edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2017.<br />points: 92","price:   31<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering. On the palate, expect sour cherry, mocha and a pleasing espresso finish bolstered by tingling acidity. Though 2010 was considered a less-than-optimal year, the vintage look like a shining star now that wines like this have had time to come into their own.<br />points: 92","price:   25<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer.<br />points: 92","price:   24<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers.<br />points: 92","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Offering aromas of a warm berry cobbler with a touch of sagebrush spice, this delivers the flavorful balance promised by the appellation.

That grittiness continues in a gravelly way in texture, rounded by strawberry and black tea.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Volatile aromas lead into fruit flavors that could be anything. It's more like Roussanne than Pinot Noir.<br />points: 84","price:   30<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Very light and shy on the nose, this wine with patience shows pomegranate punch and rain-slicked slate. The palate offers tart cranberry, a touch of Earl Grey tea and pencil-lead flavors.<br />points: 85","price:   20<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This smooth, soft wine is light and fruity. It has some tannins although fresh berry fruit and perfumed acidity are what characterize this wine. Immediately attractive, it's a light wine from a light year, and is ready to drink now.<br />points: 84","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The appellation blend from this relatively young but widely regarded property, this offers gravel, wet clay, purple and red fruits and lots of earth tones on the nose. Cranberry and sour-cherry fruit show on the palate, with eucalyptus oil in the midpalate and wet river stones and orange zest on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   34<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  One of Adam Lee's more affordable appellation blends, this delivers a lot of bang for the buck, with aromas of extracted strawberry, rich plum, sandalwood and a slate backbone. Soft red fruit starts the palate, then sharpens into cranberry, with lots of herbal spice and acidic sizzle throughout.<br />points: 90","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This excellent vineyard has a proven track record, though here the grapes seem unevenly ripened, with brambly berry fruit that turns a little hot and raisined in the finish. Hints of cola and Dr. Pepper add some welcome depth to the flavors.<br />points: 87","price:   45<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The winery's top cuvée, this offers barely ripe rhubarb and cranberry fruit flavors, with heavy tannins tasting of green coffee. The finish has a slight bitterness, but the wine overall shows medium concentration and depth, and could be cellared for a few more years to smooth it out.<br />points: 87","price:   32<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a solid, serviceable Pinot, though not a match for the very impressive 2010. Tart fruit carries a suggestion of over-ripeness as well, especially in the finish, which has an autumnal scent of fallen apples.<br />points: 87","price:   25<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A bit on the tough and chewy side, this is a decent effort in a difficult year. There is a minty, cherry candy core, with some rougher and earthier, leafier tannins surrounding.<br />points: 85","price:   85<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A terrific mouthfeel highlights this mix of berry and cherry fruits, toast and cinnamon. Tart and focused, it was aged in roughly half new French oak for the first 10 months, then transferred to neutral barrels for another five months. Fine-grained tannins give it an elegant finish.<br />points: 93","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A dark streak runs straight through this excellent Pinot. It's a whirl of smoke and chocolate, focused right through the core of rum-soaked cherries.

A complex nose of spiced plums and cherries opens into a fruit-laden midpalate, adding blackberries and a thin vein of citrus. Firmly tannic, this precise, sculpted effort brings a refined structure, with just a whiff of volatility.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Fermented in a Taransaud French oak open top tank, using Maresh Vineyard grapes exclusively, this delicious wine combines pretty cherry and pomegranate fruit with dusty spices, leading into a finish dappled with cinnamon toast and coconut.

Nothing is over-matched however, as all these 2012 Winderlea Pinots show perfect balance. The finish brings a light dusting of cocoa.<br />points: 89","price:   38<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Significantly riper than the elegant 2011, this well-priced cuvée has some real muscle. Plum and cherry fruit are set in a rather thick frame of earth and rock, buoyed by moderate acidity. Just 15% of the barrels were new.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This young and quite tart Pinot is subtly flecked with mineral, dried seaweed, and a dusty, saline character. It tastes much better than that may sound; it's complex, well structured, and unique.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is structured with red fruits. It has a thin texture, a metallic character that is less pleasant. It needs more weight and richness.<br />points: 85","price:   45<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this has the lowest alcohol, which somehow partially helps to overcome the aggressive barrel flavors. Chunky black fruits and sweet oak combine in a muscular wine that shows none of the subtlety of the grape. It's Pinot Noir on steroids.<br />points: 87","price:   12<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Self-described as a “notable every day wine” this meets the challenge. Given the price, it's a winner, with 58% of the grapes coming from the Umpqua Valley AVA.

It shows cranberry and blue-plum fruit of moderate ripeness, feeling a bit flat in the mouth. A year in 50% new French oak adds a touch of toastiness.<br />points: 86","price:   55<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Black fruits are fully ripe, then encased in massive barrel flavors. The overwhelming influence of oak brings a barrage of tobacco, smoke and charred wood. The tannins have a bitter edge.<br />points: 86","price:   25<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is dry and smoky, with tannins that will allow it to age. The fruit, though, only hints at red berry fruits and should be more developed for a simple appellation wine such as this.

Still tightly wound, it will get better with patience.<br />points: 87","price:   35<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Wood aromas and spice show strongly in this wine.

All in proportion, it's built upon an acid/mineral base, with tangy, just-ripe berry fruit. It feels quite delicate, yet has the persistence and structure of a more substantial wine.

It gains strength through the finish, lingering gracefully.<br />points: 92","price:   85<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth.

There is chalky structure to the sip, with tart and bright red plum skin flavors, but it's rather dull overall, albeit cleanly made.<br />points: 87","price:   47<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C. Iijima <br> description:  Spice, toast and savory dried herbs accent rich black cherry in this penetrating Pinot Noir.

Soft in structure at first, it then delivers a firmer tannic edge in the midpalate, all the while delivering vivacious red fruit and pine-forest flavors. It will age very well.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors.<br />points: 92","price:   16<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Green-streaked barnyard aromas couple with black cherries and tobacco in this varietally true offering.

The acidity is biting, making for a sinewy mouthful.<br />points: 83","price:   18<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Unfortunately this wine just hangs on the cusp of quality. The nose is somewhat muddy and grassy. Plummy fruit with tangy acids carry the unrefined palate. Cola nut is noticeable on the dry finish.

That intensity puts the focus on the wine's edges rather than its core fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry.

Drink soon.<br />points: 87","price:   24<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tight at first, this opens to reveal flavors of strawberry and red plum. A bit earthy and astringent, it has drying tannins that should smooth out with a bit more bottle age.<br />points: 87","price:   24<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With the extra concentration from the low-yielding old vines, this is a dense wine, with its acidity contrasting the rich red fruit.

It has concentration, although the wood flavor has an old-wood feel, seeming just a touch dirty.<br />points: 86","price:   16<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Light, fragrant, and structured, this shows a smoky flavor and refreshing red-berry fruit. It's lively and fruity, and the tannins are in the background.<br />points: 86","price:   34<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Light raspberry, cranberry, pomegranate and strawberry fruit tones greet the nose on this bottling. The aromas then offer a brick-like minerality bolstered by chiseled slate and wet river stones. Flavors are also rocky and rusty, with lots of crushed gravel and turned earth giving complexity to the cran-pomegranate fruit.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  There's a forest-floor touch to the nose of this appellation blend that also shows smoked and raw beef, hearty berries and a slight compost touch.

Just enough tannin and grape acidity provide an agile, appetizing structure to let the fresh red and black cherry notes stand out. Fermented with native yeast and aged in neutral barrels., it will be best after 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   75<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Made in a toasty, richer style, this bottling shows cherry cola, blackberry brioche, oak-smoked plums and roast beef on the action-packed nose.

It's ripe and tightly wound, a sign of the vintage and most likely, vineyard site. Needing time to open in the glass, it unwinds slowly.<br />points: 87","price:  102<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  While impressive now for its weight and flavor profile, this should evolve well, thanks to its heavy tannins and ample concentration. Right now, there is wet earth and prominent mint on the nose. The palate also picks up spearmint, with sagebrush, licorice and tobacco as well. The tannins emerge at the end of the sip, and will continue to smooth out beyond 2020.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This Dundee Hills site captures the sweet, rich black cherry fruit flavors typical of the AVA, here highlighted with accents of fresh tarragon. It's young, bright and focused, with a lingering finish that adds a pleasing pat of butter and a hint of vanilla.<br />points: 93","price:   38<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light in color it's composed of violet and rose petal aromas, zippy in acidity, with layered dark cherry fruit and an earthy, herbal backbone.

Over time, the perfume builds into a singularly resolved mélange of dark blueberry and tart cherry, the acidity perfectly able to hit the high notes. This wine should be enjoyable through 2021–2024 minimum, making an incredible partner to mushroom risotto or spring lamb.<br />points: 93","price:   46<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Another lovely Monument Tree Pinot from Couloir, this vintage is stemmy and earthy, yet soft, silky and voluptuous in all the right ways. It's pleasantly refined and ethereal, with whispers of cherry and raspberry fruitiness alongside equal parts gravitas and substance.<br />points: 93","price:   48<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The best of the three vineyard designates in 2010, this firm and full-flavored wine is still a bit tight, and rewards extra breathing time. It tastes like a bowl full of berries and plums with pretty mocha highlights.<br />points: 90","price:  100<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Aged in 100% new French oak, this seems to be a bit overwhelmed by the wood. Flavors recall black cherry cola, plus a layer of brown sugar and milk chocolate. It somehow misses some of the depth and texture that past vintages have shown.<br />points: 89","price:   26<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pretty scents of rose petal and white chocolate introduce this smooth, mouth-coating wine.

This is a balanced wine that's fresh and ready to drink.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A tiny-production Pinot by a new producer, it makes a stunning debut. Owners James Hahn and Mila Chanamé are childhood friends with longtime Anderson Valley vineyard manager Norman Kobler and the shared roots have clearly put them in sync. The wine is perfumey in lilac and violet with a lightly textured and seductive mouthfeel that's exotic in just-ripe cherry and raspberry.<br />points: 94","price:  150<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is from the vineyard that surrounds the winery, and the bottling receives both Estate and Dundee Hills designations—best of the best. It's a pungent, pleasant wine upon entry, with rather pale strawberry fruit. It quickly moves through the midpalate and turns lean, with tomato leaf and green tea astringency. There is a slight impression of alcoholic heat. Though accessible and interesting, it somehow falls short of what it could/should be, given its provenance and price.<br />points: 88","price:   22<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Forward and fruity, this has California-style fruit and sweet, strawberry candy. The difference is that it fills out the middle with some leafy, herbal flavors, nothing too rough, but enough to add some flavor interest. The finish is fat and buttery, showing the influence of oak aging.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Kiana bottling, named for the owners' granddaughter, is made with Dijon clones planted in 1996 and 1997. Initially quite tight and unyielding, it first opens into flavors of leaf, herb and green tea. Tucked neatly into the midpalate is a core of good red strawberry/cherry fruit. The tannins are earthy but not rough; everything here is balanced and well-managed; the alcohol a moderate 14.3%.<br />points: 88","price:   43<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A tart, cranberry- and raspberry-flavored wine, this young, high-acid style of Pinot has a charming, Burgundian feeling to it. The snappy red fruits are underscored with citrus, and the balance is disarmingly light, but not simple or dull.<br />points: 88","price:   43<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Aromatic with soda pop scents of Dr. Pepper, cola and root beer, this is nonetheless a reasonably substantial wine, not a simple fruit bomb. It's lively and full of interesting flavors that suggest herb, root and spice; the wood remains a background flavor.<br />points: 88","price:   20<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This brings a lot of flavor to the table for its relatively modest price. Round and spicy, it leads with juicy strawberry, cherry and apple pie fruit flavors. Hints of cinnamon wind through the finish, and overall the impression is of a pretty, lively and slightly sweet wine without pretense.<br />points: 88","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Assertive and spicy, this interesting bottling, from Amity vineyard estate grapes, shows that even at just 13% alcohol Oregon Pinot can cut it. Made in a distinctive style that is clearly neither California nor Burgundy, this herbal, intense, wine puts the focus on the aromas, a beguiling mix of pine and herb. But the fruit is there right behind, tart and sassy, with cola and root beer notes sliding into a well-modulated but tannic finish.<br />points: 88","price:   32<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Thea's Selection book-ends the single-vineyard wines and is the winery's lower-priced, multi-vineyard blend. As with the Jerome, the flavors are more complex and woven than in the single-vineyard bottlings; with cherry and berry fruit, fresh herb and streaks of bitter chocolate. It's a complete, supple wine, with no holes, moderately ripe fruit, and just a hint of heat in the finish.<br />points: 88","price:   19<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C. Iijima <br> description:  Winemaker Anthony Nappa describes Anomaly as a Pinot Noir vinified like a white wine. Bone dry, with understated black-cherry flavor, it's bracing with acidity and an intensely chalky, minerally palate. It's refreshingly quaffable, yet lingers long, sip after sip.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This vineyard is relatively far north, hence lighter fruit with flavors of sweet tomato and fresh herb. Well balanced and tannic, it brings a pretty, resonantly toasty ring to the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tart cranberry/raspberry flavors, found in many of these young Willamette Valley Vineyards Pinots, rule the palate here as well. Relatively high acidity and a restrained barrel regimen keep the oak flavors in check, but the tannins carry more than enough weight and grip for overall balance.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.<br />points: 89","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.<br />points: 89","price:   22<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Almost nonexistent in aromas, this has some light red berries that emerge with persistence. The palate is thin and watery, though clean and unflawed, with touches of root beer, cranberry and black cardamom. There's not a lot of action.<br />points: 83","price:   15<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There is not much in the way of fruit in this wine, which veers into questionable flavors of burnt mushrooms.<br />points: 82","price:   10<br />points: 82<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.<br />points: 82","price:   42<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Yates Conwill is next to the Resonance vineyard, which was just sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This vineyard is really reaching its prime, showing lovely ripe flavors of raspberry, red plum and sweet cherry. Generous acidity keeps the wine in proportion and leads through a generous midpalate with highlights of black tea and dried herb. Drink now and over the next 10 years.<br />points: 94","price:   56<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Here's a rich, full-bodied wine that rolls from the first floral sniff into a wellspring of deep, briary, berry-cherry fruit. Peppery spices and dried Mediterranean herbs meld on an endlessly fascinating finish that promises decades of development ahead.<br />points: 94","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  South African winemaker Ernst Storm is one to watch. This bottling offers a smoky, black raspberry nose, with hints of brown mustard and beef char. There's tremendous energy on the palate, though it's rather light in body, with flavors of anise, black rocks approaching asphalt, and dark but not overly ripe plums. Solid tannins ensure more interesting drinking 2017–2025.<br />points: 92","price:   38<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  A traditional and relatively light garnet color is the first sign that this is not a blatantly commercial wine. Savory, almost meaty, and cranberry-like aromas confirm the impression. Take a good sip and more crisp fruits like raspberries and red cherries emerge along with hints of cinnamon and clove for complexity. While medium bodied, it's vibrant in texture and elegantly balanced. It should improve through 2022.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Josh Klapper delivers an earthy take on the grape, with aromas of loam, tree roots, dusty chert, a touch of green olive and barely ripe wild berries. Once sipped, there are flavors of dried rose petals, raw meat, iodine, graphite and a Kalamata olive-dried cherry tapenade.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Principally blended from Abbey Ridge vineyard fruit, this offers red plum and cherry fruit, with a distinct streak of pineapple. Native yeast was employed, along with aging in one-quarter new oak, adding hints of Asian spices. The length and balance are impressive.<br />points: 92","price:   58<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This spent 11 months in 41% new oak, and there's a tasty lick of caramel running through the midpalate.

Sisters includes the three Pinot “sisters”—Blanc, Gris and Noir—in a site just below Archery Summit in the heart of the Dundee Hills. It's clean, compact, complex and nicely layered. You'll note a spicy mix of cranberry, raspberry and red licorice, along with more subtle hints of curaçao and chocolate. The structure (and winery history) suggest that this will age quite well. Drink 2018 to 2030 and beyond.<br />points: 92","price:   35<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This was sourced from Bethel Heights, which is a very good source indeed.

The ripeness of the fruit and acidity are entirely complementary.<br />points: 92","price:   29<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Produced by John Grochau (Grochau Cellars), this is stubbornly shut down, with hints of rubber tire in the aromas. Once you work past the reductive scents and flavors, it's a short wine with generic fruit and a quick finish.<br />points: 85","price:   27<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Dark pink-red in color, this wine has a ripe, sugary nose and a high-octane entry. It grows up to be tangy in citrus peel and fresh grapefruit and cherry, finishing dry.<br />points: 87","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A reserve selection from the winery's Jordan Block, this brings similar flavors with slightly more intensity. Black fruits, black pepper and some spice from barrel aging combine in a medium-bodied effort with moderate aging potential.<br />points: 88","price:   39<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Kudos to Siduri for offering a serious Oregon Pinot Noir at alcohol levels (13%) reminiscent of Burgundy. It's a welcome tilt for the state that once was tagged as the new world's Burgundian hope, but which has sometimes seemed more like a California wannabe. Light and tart, this isn't a complex wine but brings the delicate nuances of the grape, with cranberry, citrus and strawberry.<br />points: 88","price:   39<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This bottling brings strawberry preserves right up front; it's a light and spicy wine with immediate appeal. There's plenty of acid—rarely an issue in Oregon—but not much depth. It's got fruit and malted chocolate, and the finish lasts a bit longer than you might expect from the light fruit.<br />points: 88","price:   36<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak.<br />points: 85","price:   60<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From a 16-acre, dry-farmed vineyard near the producer's Carneros winery, this opens with a yeasty aroma, followed by black cherry and pomegranate. Soft, high in acidity and well-integrated in terms of oak, its finish is lingering in cinnamon and dried herb.<br />points: 88","price:   61<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This begins with a reserved nose that unfolds into deep, black aromas of licorice, turned earth and graphite. Pomegranate and acai fruit flavors mix with red clay and touches of whiskey, but the tannins are powerful.

Approachable and easygoing, a wine to enjoy now.<br />points: 88","price:   52<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This firm wine still needs to shed its youthful structure of tannin and bring out the underlying ripe fruits. It has weight, hints of juicy acidity and a medium-term potential. The end shows some of the natural concentration from old vines.<br />points: 88","price:   33<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  A big style that manages to avoid tasting rustic or heavy. Starts with baked pastry shell, black cherry and plum, then adds in hints of licorice and black pepper.

It rolls comfortably into a full-bodied core with cherry cobbler, medium length and polished tannins.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish. The pale red-fruit flavors hint at thistle and bramble more than ripe berry, but the balance is there to carry the wine well with food.<br />points: 86","price:   35<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Sean P. Sullivan <br> description:  Considering the coolness of the vintage, this wine seems surprisingly ripe with notes of cherry, strawberry, herbs and ash. It's thick and weighty in feel, making it seem a bit ponderous.<br />points: 86","price:   69<br />points: 98<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023.<br />points: 98","price:   75<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine. Succulent and balanced, it's brightly exuberant in black cherry yet brooding and complex throughout, changing slightly from savory to floral and back again. It's an incredible wine out of the gate; cellar with confidence, through 2021.<br />points: 96","price:  312<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The superb Clos de la Roche has produced a powerful and complex wine. It has concentrated black fruits and solid tannins while also showing a beautiful velvet texture that will develop into a sumptuous wine. It's still in the first youthful flush and needs many years. Drink from 2020.<br />points: 95","price:   52<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine, a regional blend, shows remarkable achievement in winemaking. Wild strawberry and red cherry exude on the entry, alongside floral elements of violet and lilac. Velvety, resolved tannins make it enjoyable from the get-go, layered in acidity for a buoyant lift on the midpalate and finish, which suggests cinnamon and tea. Enjoy now and through 2020.<br />points: 95","price:   65<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Just beautiful, this wine combines spicy, arresting aromas, vivid, bright cherry and raspberry flavors, an electric mouthfeel and bracing texture.

Virtually irresistible now, this will gain complexity through at least 2022.<br />points: 96","price:   82<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A perennial standout for good reason, this Pinot is light in color and elusive at first. Teasing in baked strawberry-rhubarb, it subtly offers a rare purity of focused fruit flavor, with gorgeous aromas of dewy rose petals playing a substantial supporting role. Thanks to subtle oak, the finish builds in terms of intensity, with the wine maintaining a delicate balance of minerality.<br />points: 96","price:   52<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty. Sly on the nose, it is tense in toasty oak and chewy cherry, venturing into black cherry, blackberry and root beer. It's amply structured and robust, yet with silky tannins.

Herbs and pine needle flavors dominate brambly berry fruit. It's quite young and raw, and will benefit from further bottle age.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A very pretty expression of Sean Thackrey's Cassiopeia's clonal experimentation, gorgeously floral and well rounded, with bright, concentrated, lush flavors of cherry with a light layering of spice. Well integrated, it's a standout among standouts.<br />points: 95","price:   55<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Wow. Black Kite's River Turn, one of of its three annual block designates, is invigoratingly inviting, a heady mix of floral cherry pie, bright, full and ripe with a balanced backbone of acidity and a gentle hint of gingerbread. This wine is ready to enjoy this second, but if you can help yourself, it'll also hold up for several years in the cellar and no matter when you decide to drink it, pair exquisitely with a range of deftly mannered food.<br />points: 95","price:   45<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background. Think a ham-and-cheese quiche gingerly sprinkled with thyme and oregano. So distinctive, one wonders what grows near this particular set of vines on the Wentzel Vineyard.<br />points: 94","price:   55<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years.<br />points: 94","price:   32<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Light tannins accompany crisp red fruits.

The finish takes a turn into bitterness.<br />points: 85","price:  100<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This bottling was supervised by retired Tualatin founder Bill Fuller. It saw 80% new oak, and barrel flavors dominate the palate. Big bursts of vanilla and tobacco somewhat mask the light cherry fruit, giving the impression that the wine is a little out of balance.<br />points: 87","price:   55<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  These old vines produce a powerful wine, that retains strong flavors of stem and earth despite the extra ripeness in 2012. The red berry fruit slides into suggestions of tomato juice.<br />points: 87","price:   32<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Much like its companion Rumba Pinot, this is light and tart, with sour cherry fruit. A whiff of smoke and streak of bell pepper come through in the finish, which is pleasant but quickly thins out.<br />points: 87","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A négociant effort, this was done entirely in stainless steel and neutral oak.

Akin to Chardonnay in its expressions of crème brûlée, tropical fruit basket and tangy apple, this wine is textured, bright in acidity and touched by oak.<br />points: 87","price:   65<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Medium weight and roundly fruity, this pleasant wine carries a touch of minerality.

It's full bodied and detailed, with excellent balance, weaving threads of site and grape into a complex finish.<br />points: 89","price:   60<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption.<br />points: 89","price:   28<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From four acclaimed Mendocino County vineyards, Winemaker Jon Grant's Straight Line Pinot is heftier than his single-vineyard bottlings from sister label Couloir. A dense style of Pinot, this has smoke and oak to it, plenty of strawberry and plum, its tannins not resolved, yet it still exhibits a lush fullness and well-rounded elegance.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  As before, the Estate Selection is the bigger of the two Pinots from Amalie, textural and clean.

The 2013 was not one of those vintages and this lean wine shows its structure more than its fruit. It gives a dry, tannic character that is unlikely to soften greatly.

It's a refreshing example from an appellation that tends toward richer, jammy styles. The palate offers raspberry and dried thyme flavors, with a touch of eucalyptus.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A restrained nose leads to spicy brown sugar, baked plum and cherry notes in this voluptuously crafted, tangy wine. It shows the warmth and depth of the appellation while retaining measured acidity and freshness.<br />points: 91","price:   57<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Old vines in a walled vineyard are responsible for this ripely structured wine. It has dense tannins and equally concentrated black fruit and acidity, needing more time to develop and yield its full fruitiness. Drink from 2018.<br />points: 90","price:   65<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Quite dark in the glass, this bottling offers black plum skin, clay, gravel and berry pie aromas. The mouthfeel is full of polished tannins and edged with sharp acidity. Dark fruit and wet earth flavors dominate.<br />points: 90","price:   25<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is well-made in a classic Oregon mold, which is to say, putting plenty of herbal highlights into the mix. There are light red fruits in abundance as well, and the flavors meld well through a medium-long finish.<br />points: 89","price:   30<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This well-priced effort is loaded with flavors, in a forward, fruit-powered style. Streaks of root beer, cola, earth and citrus create a nicely layered mouthfeel, but it's the ripe, sweet fruit that really shines here. It's perfect for drinking now through 2020.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Stalker is made by drying the stalks before embarking on whole berry fermentation. It's good to go, with bright cherry-candy flavors, light spices and a tart cranberry kick to the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine breaks on the palate like a slider crossing the corner of the plate, just out of reach. A forward, fruit-driven entry drops into a tart midpalate, with plum and berry fruit. It fades away into a finish with strong acids, light chocolate and a hint of bitterness in the tannins.<br />points: 89","price:   45<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  In a ripe and forward vintage, this is an anomaly—a low alcohol, rather gravelly wine with an emphasis on non-fruit flavors. Which is not to say it's faulty—au contraire, it's fascinating, with a well-mixed potpourri of forest floor, moist leaves, gravel and spice. Drink now and over the next couple of years.<br />points: 89","price:    9<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This is a generous, richly fruity and well-oaked wine that blends almost-jammy cherry and blackberry flavors with sweet-seeming accents like vanilla and cinnamon.

The fruit flavors are also restrained, seeming faint but still bringing appeal.<br />points: 87","price:   58<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Initially there is too much burnt wood flavor in this wine. It's only slowly that the red fruits begin to show, leaving a fresh, if lightweight character before attractive final acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   70<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A generous expression of full-bodied fruit and oak, this wine is ripe in black cherry, plum and black licorice, robust and flavorful. The finish offers integrated tannins with a hint of cinnamon spice.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Trinity's first-ever reserve is a beauty; half the barrels were new French oak, half neutral. Well-defined with juicy, citrus-flavored acidity, the cherry/berry fruit runs deep and true, while the oak aging adds buttered toast and nut oil. It offers exceptional value for the price.<br />points: 93","price:   58<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The winery sources this fruit from a vineyard near Hollister. It delivers aromas of bramble berry, espresso-dipped cherry and allspice. Cherry and chocolate power the palate, which also benefits from lifting mint, sagebrush and eucalyptus, finishing with chopped herbs.<br />points: 93","price:   85<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This demonstrates, as well as any other example, that exceptional wines were made in the often-maligned 2011 vintage. Cranberry, raspberry, cola and allspice elements are woven gracefully in a lovely wine that closes with just a faint, beguiling whiff of smoke.<br />points: 93","price:   54<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Four decades of experience shine on this Josh Jensen bottling, which mixes luxuriously ripe wild berries, raspberries and cola with the sharper spice of sweet clove and dried violet. It's bright with acidity, picking up licorice in the midpalate and finishing on a tart, slightly bitter note of crushed cranberry. This will sip well for a few years but is amazing now.<br />points: 93","price:   70<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky. The flavors are light and tart, but will pick up more savory characteristics from 2018–2024.<br />points: 93","price:   84<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This comes from one of Josh Jensen's vineyards that got barely a half-ton an acre this vintage. It offers aromas of sandalwood, leather, dried strawberry and sagebrush and is light and airy on the palate, with medium red fruits, roots and bark complexity on the midpalate. The wine finishes on nuances of hibiscus and black tea.<br />points: 93","price:   45<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Dense in tannin and yet bristling in acidity, this youthful wine is still looking for its ultimate identity.

It pleases for its brisk acidity and integrated oak.<br />points: 90","price:   29<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Winemaker Tom Mortimer also produces the outstanding Aubichon wines; this is his own label, and it offers exceptional value. It's stylish, modern and elegant, with precisely-defined raspberry fruit accented with sweet ripe tomato. The wine has a crisp sculpted mouthfeel, and just the slightest suggestion of barrel toast framing the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  From the village at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this wine is warm and ripe, with great berry flavors and a good sense of structure from tannins and wood aging.

Drink from 2021.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Smoky and soft, this full-bodied, rounded wine tastes of baked raspberry and vanilla, its texture velvety and likably smooth. Concentrated, it retains only moderate acidity, peaking in freshness on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   24<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a decent, midpriced Pinot, soft and round, with light strawberry flavors and a streak of licorice. The 18 months in 60% new French oak adds a note of vanilla as well.<br />points: 86","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A small-production Pinot that's earthy in just-picked strawberry, this offers light color and smooth, soft, silky tannins that have integrated well, though the wine remains young and fresh in the glass. It becomes weightier on the finish, expressing just the right amount of oak.<br />points: 90","price:   18<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  This wine leans more toward the earthy, savory side of Pinot Noir, yet still boasts enough plum and black cherry fruit to please most consumers.

Ready to drink.<br />points: 90","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rounded and soft, very approachable. It has attractive raspberry fruit and lively acidity, while the structure evolves slowly to show the dry edge of tannins and smoky aftertaste. For drinking now and over 4–5 years.<br />points: 88","price:  100<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This cuvée is put together from several estate vineyards, most of them marked by low vigor and cool ridge-top climates.

The thin strawberry fruit accompanies rather stemmy tannins and a green vegetal streak.<br />points: 85","price:   15<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This basic, fairly priced offering is bright in acidity with crisp, clean cherry and cola flavors.<br />points: 85","price:   25<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Past vintages of this cuvée have been delightful, but this one hits a speed bump. Diluted fruit flavors conjure up memories of cherry Kool-Aid, with a spare hint of chocolate. The wine has no depth, and not much flavor.<br />points: 85","price:   28<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a thick, syrupy-rich wine that traffics in candied cherry and oak flavors.It has appeal but lacks varietal character.<br />points: 85","price:   65<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine is solidly built with tannin and oak, a searing earthiness dulling the fruit.

It exhibits elusive fruit before peeling back bittersweet layers of cranberry, orange peel and tea. After fresh rose on the nose, it adds an element of char to the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Slightly pink in color, this Pinot Noir-based sparkler brings appealing notes of orange blossom and pink lemonade, nearing but not quite reaching bubble-gum tropicality. It's riper than its sister Blanc de Blancs, but remains very high and tight, enlivening the mouth with acidity and sour plum flavors.<br />points: 92","price:   39<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  From several of the producer's estate vineyards, this wine traffics in spicy, leathery texture and robust full-bodied power, layering in more tart savory characteristics of rhubarb, dark cherry and orange.

Some strawberry fruit leads quickly into a drying, earthy finish.<br />points: 83","price:   37<br />points: 83<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Tart and fruity, with cranberry flavors dominating. There is little or no depth or texture to this wine; it goes straight from fruit to tannin, with a bitter, astringent finish.<br />points: 83","price:   13<br />points: 84<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  Meaty aromas and scents of stewed red-berry fruits are rustic. This feels hard and high in unabsorbed acidity. A strong smear of buttery oak rests on top of edgy currant and red-plum flavors, while this is spicy and oaky on the finish.<br />points: 84","price:   90<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though Adelsheim offers a large assortment of single-vineyard Pinots, this is the first they've made from Zenith. It surely won't be the last. Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice. The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels.<br />points: 93","price:  100<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice.

With red fruits and soft tannins, it is fully of ripe berry flavors cut by acidity.A light structure in the background will allow the wine to age, although it is ready to drink now.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.<br />points: 88","price:   23<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This wine is ripe, juicy and packed with fresh red fruits. It has the softest tannins, the whole point being that this wine can be drunk young. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.<br />points: 87","price:   45<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The scents and flavors are dominated by chocolate, right from the start. The mouthfeel is tight, and herbal notes come up ahead of the light red fruit. Whole cluster fermentation was employed, perhaps accounting for the woody accents in the tannins.<br />points: 87","price:   40<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This is a soft, warm wine with ripe red fruit and attractive cherry flavors, its tannins subtly in the background.

The palate is rounded with red fruit and a clay minerality in the background.<br />points: 86","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Restrained and elegant, this is a wine on the austere side, its acidity dominant along with a firm, dry aftertaste. Produced by the other Machard de Gramont estate.<br />points: 88","price:   39<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A bright, fresh wine, its red currant and fresh plum acidity an important element. It has dry tannins at the core, giving a firm structure and hints of wood, with sweeter fruit coming through to finish.<br />points: 88","price:  120<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While there are tannins, they are not as powerful as the appellation and year would suggest. Instead, there is bright acidity, strawberry flavors and a fresh feel.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The winery's widely available Willamette Valley blend is forward, open and easy-drinking, with chocolaty cherry fruit. It's a style that should have wide appeal—smooth, toasty, with plenty of tasty chocolate highlights.<br />points: 89","price:   20<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Holding the massive bottle in your hand, you'd rightly expect the wine inside to be a bit of a monster. But instead, it's a light, almost delicate effort, with pretty cherry fruit edged in smoky toast. There is nothing to indicate either vineyard or winemaking facility, but someone has a nice elegant touch. Drink now through 2020.<br />points: 89","price:   70<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This wine shows its 40% whole-cluster fermentation in its stemmy and exotic nature that won't please every palate as it develops a strong, savory character that holds on dearly on the palate. Chewy and peppery in leather, tar and pine, it shows the cranberry and rhubarb qualities of grapes picked just-ripe.<br />points: 89","price:   49<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This young wine brings scents of cola, truffle and black cherry. It's light and lively, with those flavors coming along with notes of chicken stock and a juicy mouthfeel. Though not a big wine, it's complex and interesting.<br />points: 89","price:   60<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  With crisp fruit well to the fore, this is a bright, lively wine. Its fruitiness is balanced by firm tannins that lie in the background, lending structure. It should be aged a little longer, so drink from 2018.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This cuvée is made with the oldest block in this biodynamic vineyard. Planted in 1998, all Pommard clone, and given some extra bottle age, it's drinking well at the moment. Spicy cranberry-raspberry soda flavors come with a textural midpalate. There is a significant scent and flavor of tanned leather, which pleases some tasters more than others. That aside, the wine is complex, balanced and reasonably long.<br />points: 89","price:   40<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A pleasant wine, it has straightforward berry flavors and a wash of cola. It's slightly quick to fade.<br />points: 87","price:   55<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pretty raspberry fruit scents and flavors dominate, and in the mouth there is a sense of grainy sugars. It has good fruit and ripeness, but still seems a little disjointed. Perhaps more time in the bottle will help sort it out.<br />points: 87","price:   13<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  With nonaggressive, lightly oaked aromas of raspberry, tea and spice, this bargain-priced Pinot gets off to a nice start. The palate is bright and has good flow, while flavors of tomato, red plum, raspberry and saline are full but reserved.<br />points: 87","price:   45<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this pushes the ripeness to its limits. Nonetheless, the black-fruit flavors can't compete with the intense charred-wood character. Bitter tannins take over the finish.<br />points: 85","price:   24<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  With just 10% new oak, this wine takes on slightly overripe aromas around a taste of ripe plum and vague red fruit.

Its tannins are stiff and not yet fully integrated, and the finish evokes a dusting of dried herbes de Provence.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A tiny production wine from a vineyard long farmed by the winemaker's parents, this is herbal, tannic and oaky at first, with waves of rose petal nipping on the nose. Integrated flavors of cherry and strawberry provide a bright overlay in balance with the moderate acidity and weight.<br />points: 90","price:   39<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Dark cherry, vanilla and a quiet streak of smoke permeate the personality of this well-made light-bodied wine that's soft and supple on the palate. Raspberry and cherry flavors further define its bright fruit-forwardness and sense of freshness, with a touch of grip on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:  225<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity. Then the tannins power in, a dry core of structure and density. Impressive and long-lasting, don't touch this wine for another six years at least.<br />points: 96","price: 2000<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging.<br />points: 96","price:  575<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin. It is foursquare, solid but not overbearing, leaving room for a delicious mix of black fruits and power leavened with some acidity. Age this wine for 10 years.<br />points: 96","price:  300<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background. Keep this wine at least five years, probably 10.<br />points: 95","price:  400<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Smoky, rich, this wine packs a powerful punch of vibrant black cherry fruits, and generous sweet tannins. It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age.<br />points: 95","price:  200<br />points: 95<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Not all Clos Vougeot lives up to its billing, but this wine certainly does. With its superbly ripe fruit, a harmonious balance between fruit, tannins and acidity, and a full, generous texture, this is a wine to savor. It is a big wine in all senses, except that it has a great sense of proportion. Enjoy this wine in 2–3 years, or age for 10.<br />points: 95","price: 1125<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While it starts austerely, this wine is obviously going to be a powerhouse of red plum and other ripe red fruits. The aromas are smoky, and this also shows in the palate as the wine fills with juicy richness, finishing with tight acidity. Give it 5–10 years.<br />points: 94","price:   85<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A complete wine that speaks of both richness and terroir. While the tannins are certainly there, they are dominated by rich black fruits, ripeness, power and concentration. It is the sort of wine that reveals many layers of flavor and complexity. Age for five years.<br />points: 94","price:   20<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Michael Schachner <br> description:  This is dark in color, with full plum, berry, leather and mild chocolate aromas. Tobiano delivers a medium-to-full body, with ample stuffing and flavors of dark plum, oak and spice. This shows a smooth finish, controlled oak and good body weight. Drink now–2015.<br />points: 89","price:   44<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light in color and texture, with faint mushroom and earth tones and wispy swirls of cherry, this Pinot is silky with perceptible acidity and a finish of spicy mint. It's structured enough in body to pair beautifully with a range of food.<br />points: 89","price:   42<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This wine starts off well with an aromatic mix of red fruit, citrus and toasted grain. The palate shows thick tannins and a stemmy finish which cut the flavors short.<br />points: 86","price:   28<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This young wine has tart, rather thin fruit flavors of pomegranate and wild berry. There's ample acidity—maybe too ample for some tasters. Flavors seems to fall off and fade quickly.<br />points: 86","price:   70<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   60<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine.<br />points: 88","price:   65<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Planted to a single Dijon clone (114), this single block of Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard expresses its individuality with precision and spot-on balance. Barrel toast meets buttery berries, and the 15% alcohol shows no trace of heat or burn. Rather, it suggests an increasingly rare honesty and lack of manipulation; this is what it takes to ripen these grapes. Many people would love to see that number come down, but the flavors are there, the balance is there, and most importantly, the elegance is (still) there.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Aggressively herbal, dark and slatey, this arresting Pinot Noir is distinctive and powerful; it won't appeal to everyone, but those who like it will appreciate its uniqueness. There is an impression of clay and a hardness to the fruit, but it's compact enough to suggest a reasonably long life ahead.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Delara is Maysara's mid-priced Pinot Noir. The wine is a block selection, and it is still rather tightly wound, despite the extra time in bottle. The fruit is dark and laden with exotic spices, and as you dive into the flavors you find smoke, licorice, earth and rock. This is a wine that would be quite interesting to age, but if you drink it now, be sure to spend time with it, as it runs through its delightful changes. Decanting is highly recommended.<br />points: 90","price:   79<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  The wine is structured with solid tannins and a foursquare character. Ripe fruits with plenty of balancing acidity give this wine its density and its crisp edge. This is a fruity wine that will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2020.<br />points: 91","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a soft, approachable wine, rightfully representative of its roots in the heart of the appellation.

It has great balance, reserved raspberry and black cherry flavors and an appetizing, firmly tannic texture. Save a few bottles until 2020 to see how well it develops.<br />points: 91","price:   60<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Clove, star anise and deep strokes of red cherry show on the nose of this bottling from one of the estate's best blocks. The palate is redolent with bay leaf and eucalyptus, which give depth to the red-cherry, cranberry and tart pomegranate flavors.<br />points: 91","price:   25<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Union Wine Company, which now owns Amity, makes a number of good-value, well-structured Pinots. Add this one to the list. Aged 11 months in 15% new French oak, it's pleasingly fruity (raspberry and cherry) but doesn't stop there. The touch of barrel-aging adds coffee and caramel highlights.<br />points: 88","price:   19<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A good value for the quality, this wine is smooth and velvety. Easy drinking, it offers an integrated texture dotted in dark cherry, allspice and plum. Full bodied, it remains soft and approachable from start to finish.<br />points: 88","price:   41<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Now fully mature and showing some bricking at the rim, this is a savory, earthy example of Marlborough Pinot Noir. Roasted cauliflower and caramelized root veggies sound strange but are actually quite pleasant, while hints of dried fruit and molasses add the suggestion of fruit sweetness. Drink now.<br />points: 90","price:   28<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  This medium-bodied wine successfully blends several disparate notes into a harmonious whole. Hints of just-turned earth, cola, root vegetables, clove and fresh greens join on the nose, while the palate adds fruitier overtones of red cherries and berries. The tannins are silky, the acids vibrant.<br />points: 90","price:   80<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The slightest hint of pale pink-orange in the glass, this late disgorged sparkler shows steel, lightly chilled dough yeast, lemon chiffon, crisp nectarine and an alkaline element on the nose. Mandarin orange peel, iodine and grapefruit pith slice through the palate, which is rounded by touches of melon and bubblegum flavors.<br />points: 90","price:   30<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon.<br />points: 87","price:   20<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  French speakers will note that père (meaning “father”) is misspelled on the label. The intent is to honor the winemaker's father, who planted the estate vineyard 30 years ago. It's a sturdy, honest wine, chewy and unafraid to show the slightly bitter, herbal side of the grape. Drink this with a hearty lamb stew.<br />points: 87","price:   95<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.<br />points: 94","price:   67<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  The producer's flagship wine, this is sourced from several Green Valley sites, including Amber Ridge and Manna. Both contribute a full-bodied wealth of packed-earth flavor in a generously layered, rich explosion of dark cherry, plum and pomegranate. Along the way, streaks of citrus and black tea provide exotic interludes.<br />points: 93","price:   65<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sporting the AVA's classic, concentrated black-cherry fruit, this carries a strong whiff of fresh cut tobacco. Those flavors control the palate, with lemony acids and a light touch of spice.<br />points: 93","price:   25<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This amazing wine can match up against wines double the price. Brawny red berries and wild cherries mix with cut sagebrush, eucalyptus and crushed graphite on the nose. The palate combines bright red, acid-driven raspberry fruit with the darker structure of elderberry. Throw in thyme and bay leaf for the complete package.<br />points: 93","price:   19<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A fresh and juicy wine, full of red fruits as well as striking acidity. The tannins are soft, but do offer a core of firm dryness. For aging over the next two years.<br />points: 85","price:   29<br />points: 81<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Starts like sweet strawberry candy, quickly turns plastic, dilute, with an unpleasant, artificial, plastic finish.<br />points: 81","price:   85<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Opening with a strong streak of herb, bitter root and pepper, this carries those flavors on into a palate of cherry fruit, highlighted with orange peel. It's an intriguing wine, still a bit austere, and not as fruit-forward as many in this highly-regarded vintage.<br />points: 90","price:   36<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Round and full-bodied, this block selection reflects the warmth of the Pommard and Dijon clones. The acids have a juicy, citrus character, and there is a streak of cola along with bright cherry fruit.<br />points: 90","price:   34<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Grapes from two vineyards—Hyland in the McMinnville AVA, and Fortmiller in the Rogue Valley AVA—combine gracefully in a young wine with juicy citrus and ripe blackberry flavors. Eleven months in 40% new French oak adds dark chocolate around the typical earthy minerality of the Hyland fruit. There are substantial tannins, so give this extra aeration, or cellar for another few years.<br />points: 90","price:   14<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  This is a light- to medium-bodied wine with a soft, silky texture. Cherries, mushrooms and just the smallest of herbal nuances end on a faintly dusty note.

Velvety on the palate it also possesses a tannic bite and showy oak.<br />points: 87","price:   70<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A whiff of Bourbon and vanilla introduces this block selection, then leads into a fine-tuned palate with blue plum, cola, clean earth and graphite. It's elegant without being thin, and pushes through gracefully to a lingering, perfectly balanced finish.<br />points: 92","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Tantara's 2012 Pinots tend to be cloudy and light like this one, which delivers aromas of cranberry and allspice. It's very soft on the palate, with light chai flavors and the tartness of barely ripe pomegranate.<br />points: 92","price:   21<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This offers exceptional concentration and power. Sweet strawberry fruit is dense and detailed, bringing hints of spice and milk chocolate into play through a long, utterly satisfying finish.<br />points: 92","price:   70<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Single-clone wines can be less complex than clonal blends, but not in this case. The nose is dominated by anise, but the slightly bitter flavors are richer than Tantara's other Rio Vista Vineyard bottling, almost reminiscent of spicy beef goulash. Similarities do persist, though, such as the supple and suave mouthfeel, with an enduring finish.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Made in small quantities, this Pinot is light in color and gorgeously rendered in earthy, forested notes of Bing cherry and strawberry. Lean and buoyant in acidity, it was given 30% new oak, providing subtle depth and complexity without masking the wine's balance of fruit and earth.<br />points: 92","price:   80<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Old vines give this single-parcel wine its power and concentration. Long wood aging hasn't diminished the richness of the fruit, the juicy acidity and the succulent berry flavors. It's a wine that's full and structured, likely to age well. Drink from 2018.<br />points: 92","price:   60<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Extremely light and transparent in color, this wine has a nose that mixes light raspberry fruit with diced green olive, pimento and burned rubber funk. The olive tapenade carries to the palate with a just-ripe strawberry, making for a lean, savory vintage, which is carried with vibrant acidity that lasts into days two and three.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This shows some extra concentration in its plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel has a pleasing texture, and the streaks of herb and cola are nicely integrated.

The palate shows chai and Indian spice—accents to the cranberry fruit that rides a fine line between ripe and tart. Although light in body, the tannic structure is firm enough to cellar for decades. Drink now–2033.<br />points: 96","price:   50<br />points: 96<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  This bottling showcases Jim Clendenen's brilliance at making light wines packed with flavor.

Though each of Lemelson's single vineyard wines has its own unique particularity, this wine takes the best of them and gracefully pulls them all together. A gentle mix of spice, floral, mocha, forest and chocolate streaks, it is buttressed with firm purple fruits and polished tannins.<br />points: 90","price:   42<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Forward and accessible, this wine has broadly displayed flavors of berry and milk chocolate, along with more subtle details of cayenne and herb.

It's harder, chewier, less open and more challenging. It may also age more slowly. Right now there is a certain stemminess and bitterness to the tannins that keeps the fruit at bay, though the aromas seem to promise more. It may profit from an hour or two of breathing.<br />points: 87","price:   14<br />points: 87<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.<br />points: 87","price:   40<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Pronounced FOO-kway, this is the highest in alcohol but the lowest in flavor of the Erath line up.

Tangy fruit flavors of wild berries are soaked with earth and mineral. Tannins are sharp and just slightly green, but the most interesting aspect is the spicy, resinous, pine needle bouquet that continues right on through the mid-palate.<br />points: 90","price:   26<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Solid fruit brings firm, taut black cherry and cola flavors to the front. This is a muscular, flavorful, somewhat blocky wine that brings Pinot Noir up to burger wine status—and you may take that as a compliment. Some barrel toast adds butter and almond to the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   49<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Damp forest floor give this wine a strong character of earthiness and wintery, savory notes, surrounded by intense black cherry, oak and firm, sizable tannins.

It's a tight, light and minimally messed-with wine, bright in cherry, pomegranate and rose.<br />points: 91","price:   35<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  A fairly complex, rich and layered nose of stewed plum, root beer, mace and allspice is set against an oak-laden, vanilla-based structure on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers rich black plum, but with decent tang, as well as earthy chipped slate and iron elements, before settling into light licorice spice.<br />points: 91","price:   79<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Flavor complexity is the strong suit of this multi-layered and distinctive wine. Aromas range from floral to minty to toasty to rhubarb-like, and flavors reflect an equally wide range. The texture, too, is intricate and complex, showing good balance and enough richness to project a lingering, spicy finish.<br />points: 93","price:   42<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on.<br />points: 93","price:   66<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  One of the more engaging single-vineyard expressions this winery makes from the region, this bottling by winemaker Bill Brousseau hits the nose with ripe black cherries, crushed slate, dried violets, purple Thai basil and light black licorice. Desiccated pomegranate tones lead the lush yet lively palate that is layered with peppery spice and a touch of herbs.<br />points: 93","price:   55<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  From an amazing vineyard set at 1,200 feet with ocean views across the Carmel Valley, this bottling shows soft plum and strawberry fruit along with wild thyme, wet slate, a touch of smoke and purple-flower essence. A lively mouthfeel presents flavors of red plum, wild forest berries, chipped slate and sandalwood on a medium-light body.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Sometimes clonal studies miss components, but not so in this bottling. Pretty fruit tones of red cherry and stewed raspberry are layered across vanilla foam on the nose. The palate is framed by a cherry-pie richness, yet retains brightness and freshness thanks to rising anise, fresh oregano and crushed pencil lead. It finishes on vanilla bean.<br />points: 93","price:   18<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Stainless-steel fermented, this crisp, thirst-quenching wine is fruity, floral and highly inviting, focused in well-defined flavors of tangerine and lemon. High in acidity without ever pushing too far, it remains complex and textured on the palate, finishing with a memorable tang.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  All the Lemelson Pinots in 2014 are strikingly similar—rather light, tart, clean and simple. Cranberry and raspberry fruit, bright and tangy, tells the whole story here. Drink it over the next few years while that freshness remains.<br />points: 89","price:   42<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Young and tight, this new release shows excellent aging potential. The fruit is compact and complex, a lush mix of pomegranate, raspberry and cherry, spiced gracefully with sweet baking spices. There is a delicate herbal note as well, and the overall balance is superb.<br />points: 92","price:   50<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Blistered tomato dominates the aromatic profile on Roblar's top-end Pinot Noir bottling. The flavors are also quite pleasing, with the savory umami of stewed tomatoes again leading the way, with some violet and other purple flowers singing back-up. The palate is silky, the finish properly acidic, and the alcohol is nicely restrained. Serve with pasta alla puttanesca.<br />points: 92","price:   45<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Beginning to round out its youthful edges, the BlackCap (so named for the native Oregon mushroom, berry and bird) offers pretty pie-cherry fruit, savory herbs and silky tannins. There's still some phenolic bite to the finish, suggesting that it can continue to smooth out over the next few years.<br />points: 91","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a new project for Chris Figgins (Leonetti Cellar, FIGGINS, Doubleback), using grapes sourced from the Ribbon Ridge and Schindler vineyards. Dense with an exotic weave of aromatics, it has the irresistible appeal of the 2012 vintage. Mulberry, plum, cinnamon and a dash of truffle salt all combine in a plush, generous, well-integrated wine, with a rich, textural mouthfeel.<br />points: 91","price:   40<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondré and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age.

Iijima <br> description:  Darkly toasted oak, dried herb and mushroom notes add warmth and earthiness to this delicately fruity Pinot Noir. The palate is ruddy and rustic with subtle sour-cherry sweetness, but bright acidity and a swathe of green herb drive the fresh, clean finish.<br />points: 86","price:   18<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Anna Lee C.

Refined and light to medium bodied, it picks up a tight-grained, oaky, leathery intrigue on the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   54<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This svelte wine is smooth and supple, its strawberry and cherry fruit laced with a vein of milk chocolate.

The earthiness continues through the midpalate and finish, with notes of mushroom and forest floor that linger through the close.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This has a noticeable but well-modulated streak of herb running down the fruit core. Tart cranberry and raspberry flavors seem at first stiff and a bit unyielding, but that's just youth. Give this one until 2017–2018 and it should blossom.<br />points: 90","price:   26<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Some high-toned fruit comes up quickly from the glass, and gives the palate a welcome lift. Strawberries and chocolate are the first impression, with nuances of fresh herb and pepper, then more chocolate, as the wine plays out across the palate. Good length and structure make this an excellent value in its price range.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Forward, rich and set in a base of herb, coffee grounds and pencil lead, this wine immediately displays both power and complexity. The fruit is moving along a fast-track aging curve, but drinking beautifully right now, with acids and tannins in proportion. Black cherry cola and highlights of fresh thyme make for an interesting palate.<br />points: 90","price:   58<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish.<br />points: 88","price:   80<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  While this wine certainly has a tannic background, it is already showing fruitiness and ripe berry and red plum flavors. That makes for a warm, rounded wine that will age relatively quickly. Drink from 2016.<br />points: 88","price:   45<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A grippy Pinot Noir with a hint of menthol on the nose, this wine is otherwise delicately high in acidity with a burst of tart cherry that swirls between soft, round tannins and brambly blackberry on the finish.<br />points: 88","price:   36<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  The nose offers crushed cinnamon sticks sprinkled upon just-picked raspberries and squeezed plums. The palate brings heavier red fruits, approaching boysenberry and pomegranate juice, with a clove spice throughout.<br />points: 88","price:   38<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light and ephemeral, Winery Block comes from one vineyard planted to three clones (Swan, Dijon 114 and Mt.

The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now.

This young wine seems built for the wine cellar. If you plan to drink it sooner, give it an hour in the decanter.

Dr Pepper and spicy herbs decorate a solid midpalate that flows into a lengthy finish with confectionary highlights.<br />points: 90","price:   72<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.<br />points: 90","price:   44<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the “regular” Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.<br />points: 90","price:   20<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category.

It charms immediately with scents of dusty baking spices and cherry pie. Flavors follow into a graceful and proportionate finish.<br />points: 90","price:   34<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is a delicate wine, true to variety with musky scents and flavors of beetroot, cherry and cola. The only off-note is a hint of plastic in the aftertaste.<br />points: 86","price:   50<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Matt Kettmann <br> description:  Woody fruit notes of elderberry and bramble meet with graphite and sagebrush on the nose of this block-designated bottling from the longtime growing family. Plums and cranberries get a serious juniper and pine-sap twist on the palate, laid across lots of loamy earth. The grippy character will soften and protect this wine, so drink 2018–2025.<br />points: 91","price:   55<br />points: 91<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Wild earth and forest floor surround elements of truffle, black tea and cardamom in this vineyard-designate, a savory and wholly compelling wine. Crisp orange blossom and orange peel buoy the minerality and sensation of crushed rocks and rose petals.<br />points: 91","price:   65<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Rich fruit, layered with acidity, stars in a wine that is dense, very much a product of the powerful 2005 vintage. With the concentrated tannins, this is showing that it needs to age, but already the sweet fruits are opulent and soft.<br />points: 92","price:   55<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Firm and tense, this is a wine on the high wire. The tannins are stretched with acidity, the berry fruits and red cherry flavors vividly standing out against this structure. The aftertaste is fine, poised, mineral. This is developing into an important wine.<br />points: 92","price:  125<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Dense, concentrated, solid, this wine shows the stern side of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are dry, very firm and rough at the edges. The fruit is just as edgy, with black, juicy plums surrounded by smoky wood and tobacco. The wine needs to age, although it will always have a solid, structured character.<br />points: 92","price:   96<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  In its early stages of evolution, this wine offers mainly stoniness, firm acidity and a hard- edged structure. Of course it will soften, but this will likely remain a tannic wine, the fruit always edged with acidity, for many years. It is potentially a great wine that just needs patience.<br />points: 92","price:  149<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  This shows the proper attention to structure that is the inheritance of any Nuits-Saint-Georges. But around that structure, Gilles Jayer builds a velvet curtain of ripe black fruits, touched with spice and leavened with acidity. It's a wine that is delicious now, but certainly should be aged.<br />points: 92","price:  100<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A lively, fresh wine that gives joy, with its delicious sweet red fruits. It fills the mouth with freshness, as well as showing some tense tannins. The aftertaste continues this vibrant theme, with sweet acidity and ripe fruit.<br />points: 92","price:  160<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  From its privileged position right next to the grand cru of La Tâche, Aux Malconsorts has produced a heady, perfumed wine, relatively delicate, relying on its succulent red fruits to give body. It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious.<br />points: 92","price:   23<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from old-vine Wädenswil clones, this effort carries the new Elkton AVA designation. Pretty raspberry and strawberry fruit is set in lightly toasty tannins. This is a lovely everyday Pinot Noir with some density.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Floral scents float above a chunky, cherry-fruited, single-vineyard wine. It's quite refreshing, with appealing texture and underlying minerality that compensates for the overall impression of palate lightness.

Consistent from vintage to vintage is the elegance and depth of detail, beginning with subtle, entwined fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. Hints of dried herb, cigar box, and a touch of chocolate come up through the finish. The tannins are proportionate, though still a bit astringent, suggesting a few more years of bottle age would be beneficial.<br />points: 92","price:   48<br />points: 92<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This fascinating, distinctive wine has a frame of grapefruity citrus around peppery pomegranates.

Penetrating and sharp, with excellent definition.<br />points: 90","price:   40<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  A real success in a challenging vintage, this is a meaty, flavorful, well-built Pinot Noir. The fruit is a mix of berries, especially strawberry, with accents of peach, cola, earth, sassafras and cinnamon. The wine keeps on going; it doesn't wimp out or turn bitter. It's interesting now, but should develop even more flavor with some years of cellaring.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 85<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish.<br />points: 85","price:   72<br />points: 94<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  The flavors run as deep as the dark garnet color in this full-bodied but sophisticated wine. Aromas trigger black cherry, subtle spicy oak and a walk in the forest, while the fruit flavors are ripe and delicious. The texture is like velvet—smooth but not slick.

Rhubarb, pomegranate, peppermint, earth and savory herbs are all highlights, and the length is equally impressive. It's low in alcohol, but high in aging potential.<br />points: 91","price:   48<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Oak jumps out first, both on the nose and on the palate, before waves of grenadine liqueur and raspberry take over. Velvety in texture, the wine is earthy, with well-integrated tannins and a lingering finish.<br />points: 88","price:   46<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A bite of spicy wild strawberry marks this wine in flavor and aroma, complementing the soft, lush layers that follow. A candied, marshmallow-like quality gives the wine a sense of ripeness that is probably more pronounced aromatically than otherwise. The sense of sweetness is offset by balanced acidity and a lengthy, spicy finish.<br />points: 88","price:   35<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  There's a substantive strength and intensity of ripe black cherry to this wine that's well-intentioned in its seamless and soft texture.

Next to the spice, the red currant and berry fruits are intensely fresh and disclose a tight line of acidity. The wine is still young, although developing well as the acidity softens.

The palate is powered by a lively bitterness of underripe raspberries, raw coffee beans and more green peppers, yet will probably age better than most of its vintage counterparts.

There is decent tension on the sip, where cooked cranberry and strawberry meet with a backbone of allspice and nutmeg as well as bittersweet chocolate.<br />points: 89","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Light and forward, this pleasant, single vineyard selection opens with pretty raspberry and black cherry fruit and an impression of spritziness. The flavors suggest Campari, with light streaks of herb and anise.<br />points: 88","price:   68<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This is significantly lighter than the 2010 edition, both in color and in flavor. Red apple and tart cherry fruit combines into a wine with plenty of acidity. There's a flavor of cracker running through the core, and continuing after the fruit fades away.<br />points: 88","price:   50<br />points: 88<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  There's some muscle and meat to this tight young wine, with black raspberry and cherry fruits. But those flavors feel squeezed by the chalky sour-lemon acidity, which may or may not soften with additional bottle age.<br />points: 88","price:   55<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Elizabeth's Reserve is comprised of Adelsheim's “best barrels from our best lots.” In this light vintage it brings scents and flavors of pretty cherry and apple fruit, along with a hint of milk chocolate. The tannins are moderate, and there's a streak of root beer and a little stemmy bitterness carrying through the finish.<br />points: 89","price:   44<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This fragrant, concentrated wine offers vivid mint, cherry and clove aromas followed by rhubarb, red cherry and rosemary flavors that are focused and memorable.

Best after 2022.<br />points: 93","price:   68<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  One of three designated cuvées from Freeman, this intriguing wine has a rather light color but beautiful, complex fruit aromas and flavors. It ranges from red cherry to rhubarb and raspberry, along with hints of forest floor and mushroom. A surprisingly gentle texture complements tangy acidity.<br />points: 93","price:   56<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  Beautifuly integrated oak spice and a deep well of fruit flavors combine in this richly complex and layered wine. It's medium to full in body, supple and mouthfilling in texture, and brings a great array of classic aromas to the table. Dark cherry, forest floor, cedar and a hint of wood smoke meld into a feast of flavor.<br />points: 93","price:   82<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Jim Gordon <br> description:  This is a big, dark and concentrated wine with exotic spicy, oaky aromas, rich and ripe fruit flavors, an absolutely creamy, mouthfilling texture and lingering finish. Deft touches of graphite and cedar in the aromas meet generous black plum, mint and cherry on the palate.<br />points: 93","price:   48<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This is a spicy, earthy and medium-bodied selection, lengthy and concentrated in cardamom and forest pine.

The spiciness persists through the finish.<br />points: 90","price:   30<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate. It features a mix of red cherry and sage, with a full body and an expansive and lengthy finish.<br />points: 90","price:   16<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This might be the best value Pinot out there. Light in color and strong in Bing cherry flavor and aroma, smoothly textured and well-balanced, it's made from organic grapes to boot. A fine and rare example of a Mendocino Pinot that's not overly complicated or fussy.<br />points: 90","price:   60<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  This bigger style of Pinot takes some time to open up, coming from the warmer end of the Anderson Valley, closer to Boonville, known as “The Corners.” With a thickness to the texture it grandiosely boasts of dark Mediterranean spice and leather, with a dark cherry fruit expression coasting throughout.<br />points: 90","price:   34<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Though labeled simply “Oregon,” this is 100% Hyland vineyard fruit from the McMinnville AVA. Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel. Smooth as silk, this will be tough to ignore in your cellar, though it will reward another three to five years of bottle age.<br />points: 93","price:   76<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A generous wine, this is packed with red fruits as well as firmly structured.

With all these elements in place, the wine will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2021.<br />points: 93","price:   40<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  What stands out most in this wine is its floral flirtation, the ability to draw in the nose effortlessly and seductively. From there, it offers cherry-berry, cola and peppery clove in equal measure, the acidity in check and spicy on the tongue.<br />points: 93","price:   60<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Sourced from one of the finest vineyards in Oregon, this brings ripe, fleshy, full-bodied fruit flavors front and center.

As befits a wine from Nuits Saint-Georges, it is dark with tannins as well as fruit. It has a good structure, with dense blackberry and plum flavors that are developing. Give this wine until 2022.<br />points: 93","price:   36<br />points: 93<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This biodynamically farmed vineyard is often found as a named designate, and for good reason. It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry.<br />points: 93","price:   19<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  A rounded wine, benefiting from the fruitiness of the year to give soft tannins, ripe strawberry fruits and an attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although could age a few months.<br />points: 86","price:   25<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  A nutty undertow finds its way in this wine, which is marked by an earthiness of sage, clove and sous bois. Funky and desirable, it leans medium-bodied in weight and tone, with an undeniable affront of blood orange and crisp red cherry.<br />points: 90","price:   50<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  The Nicholas reserve sees one-third new French oak.

It drinks well already, with a smooth well-integrated finish.<br />points: 90","price:   22<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  This has the pretty slightly candied flavors of a black-raspberry lifesaver, but with the extra dimensions of flavor that well-crafted wines provide. The acids are ample and the tannins light, but somehow this rather delicate wine carries gracefully on through a lingering layered finish. Nicely done, in a lovely package, and a fine value.<br />points: 90","price:   36<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Virginie Boone <br> description:  Light in color and delicate in texture, this wine is bright in pomegranate and raspberry, with a spritzy, carbonic edge that brings freshness to a deep, rich finish of strawberry and tea.<br />points: 90","price:   28<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Good grip is immediately apparent, along with a burst of tangy citrus and cherry fruit. Sour plum comes up as well, and it's clearly the fruit, not the barrels, that are in the center ring. A high-acid finish keeps it fresh and lively.<br />points: 90","price:   55<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Chewy and packed with flavors of dark chocolate, espresso and a bit of cracker, this retains focus as it punches through to a tasty finish.

This is a wine under tension, with a strong mineral element, cool and fresh, best with food.<br />points: 89","price:   62<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Pure, ripe strawberry flavors are pierced with acidity. The texture is soft, with a dry side. The raspberry acidity cuts right to the end.<br />points: 89","price:   65<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Soft, ripe and rich, this is very easy on the palate. The wine does have good depth of flavor from the rounded black cherry flavors, the fruit almost sweet in its openness. It is already delicious.<br />points: 89","price:  115<br />points: 89<br />tasted by:  Roger Voss <br> description:  Concentrated, with dark tannins to go with the ripe fruit.

Very perfumed, with hints of mineral and final acidity.<br />points: 88","price:   23<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit. The cedary, coffee-tinged oak continues on the palate, where it imparts a slightly dry, tannic edge to this otherwise supple, rounded wine. Give it a year or two to see if the oak integrates with time.<br />points: 86","price:   17<br />points: 86<br />tasted by:  Joe Czerwinski <br> description:  A slightly chunky Pinot Noir, with sturdy black cherry fruit, mushroomy overtones and a cedary touch.

But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste.<br />points: 91","price:   75<br />points: 90<br />tasted by:  Paul Gregutt <br> description:  Citation is given as much as a decade of bottle age prior to release, which means it is pre-cellared and drinking at its peak.
