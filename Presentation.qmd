## About Me

- My name is Corey Cassell, I am an engineer in aerospace and aspiring data scientist.
- I am currently closing out the final half of my data science masters program.
- In particular I am interested in applying machine learning models to manufacturing problems to help predict and respond to daily production gaps before they occur. 

## Here's a classification project example that I completed for school
