## About Me

- My name is Corey Cassell, I am an engineer in the commercial aerospace industry and an aspiring data scientist.
- I am currently closing out the final half of my data science masters program.
- In particular I am interested in applying machine learning models to manufacturing problems to help predict and respond to daily production gaps before they occur. 

## Here's a classification project example that I completed for school
- I will be using the caret library in conjunction with the wine dataset to do this analysis
- Here's an example of the data from this set:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# add your libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(randomForest)
library(DT)
wine = read_rds("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobbyjy/MyData/main/pinot.rds")
datatable(head(wine, n = 3))

```
